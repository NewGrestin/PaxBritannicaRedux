### thanks KR, those are ambition areas ;P
### Priority Zones
###
### Each country has a list of states/regions which it will take in a peace conference even if it
### doesn't have claims/cores. Other countries in their faction will let them take these areas unless there's a conflict.
### If they're a minor, or they're in a faction but not the leader, they won't expand outside of this ambition area unless
### there's no-one involved in the peace conference who can take the land.
###
### If a country is NOT in this list, then it only takes cores/claims.
