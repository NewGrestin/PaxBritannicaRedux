PB_CMC_People_of_Horse_desc:0 "Horses forever changed life on the Great Plains. They allowed tribes to hunt more buffalo than ever before. They tipped the balance of power in favor of mounted warriors. And they became prized as wealth. For Native Americans today, horses endure as an emblem of tradition and a source of pride, pageantry, and healing.\n The Comanche have mastered warfare with horses. They are experts in raiding, hit and run attacks and attritional warfare. Many civilized armies have suffered great defeats facing them."
PB_Benefits_of_Slavery:0 "The Withering Slave Trade"
PB_Benefits_of_Slavery_desc:0 "Everyone feared going through Comanche lands for centuries. Because when you did there was no guarentee to leave as a free man.\nThe Comanche have build up their wealth and security by become Slavers. In the last century they supplied New Dixie the majority of their slaves and becoming their most valuable partner. Through the Slave Trade the Comanche people gained in exchange money and weapons.\nBut with the end of Slavery in New Dixie, the main source of income for the Comanche is withering away. Soon there will be nothing worth to be gained from it expect hatred from our neighbours."
