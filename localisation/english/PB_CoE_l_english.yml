  PB_CoE_Conference_of_Europe:0 "The Conference of Europe"
  PB_CoE_Conference_of_Europe_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second war that has decimated Europe in 20 years has finally come to an end. Cities now resemble smoldering graveyards, while entire villages have been wiped off the map, either due to national projects of achieving \"natural populations\" or due to the hellish machines and innovations unleashed upon the continent during the war. Roads and railways are broken and beyond repair, while industrious factories now seem abandoned. \n\nWith the powers that challenged the status quo now destroyed, Britain, Germany and their allies now seek to partition the pie correctly. It remains to be seen how possible that will be, as some seek revenge for the devestation or national humiliation, while others seek to bring unity to a divided Europe. \n\nCurrent Topic of the Conference: [Coe_get_topic] \n"
  PB_CoE_Add_A_Demilitarization_Clause:0 "Demilitarisation of French Society"
  PB_CoE_Add_A_Demilitarization_Clause_desc:0 "To placate the German diplomats, we may introduce an extensive plan to demilitarise the French state to the Dexter Plan. This will hinder French capabilities to build autopods, tanks, artillery, bio-genetic weaponry, airplanes and any military-grade ship or submarine. While it may prove to be the hand the Germans needed to approve of this plan, it would seriously neuter a friendly French military in the forseeable future."
  PB_CoE_Allow_Lorraine_Occupation:0 "Occupy Lorraine"
  PB_CoE_Allow_Lorraine_Occupation_desc:0 "It seems unlikely that the Germans would be satisfied with simply keeping the current borders with France untouched. A compromise needs to be made, allowing the continued occupation of the previously demilitarised province of Lorraine by German forces. Britain will approve of the Lorraine occupation for at least 100 years, unless Germany decides to relinquish its control over the territory in the future."
  PB_CoE_A_Jewish_Homeland:0 "Discuss a Jewish Homeland"
  PB_CoE_A_Jewish_Homeland_desc:0 "The Jewish people have suffered immensely under the French regime, seeing insane forms of persecution. While a rather unorthodox proposal, a few German diplomats have proposed to grant the Jewish people a part of France as repayment for the unethical and immoral projects targetting French jews of the former French government."
  PB_CoE_GER_choose_place_for_israel:0 "Pick [FROM.GetName] as Jewish Homeland"
  PB_CoE_GER_choose_place_for_israel_desc:0 "Coastal, a nice climate and small: this territory is the perfect homeland for the Jewish people!"
  PB_CoE_Implement_Full_Deindustrialisation:0 "Total Deindustrialisation"
  PB_CoE_Implement_Full_Deindustrialisation_desc:0 "Schwarz, in his essay on France, draws an interesting picture of how Germany could completely dominate France for the next thousand years. Calling it \"turning back the clock\", this euphemistic phrase describes the systematic destruction of France's industrial capabilities, ranging from civilian production to the extraction of heavy resources. Through total deindustrialisation, France can be tied to a German market and remain subservient for the next decade to come."
  PB_CoE_Independent_Normandy_Compromise:0 "The Rouen Compromise"
  PB_CoE_Independent_Normandy_Compromise_desc:0 "To create such a powerful state in continental Europe is begging to destroy the delicate balance of power in the eyes of the British. While supportive of their German allies, the Brits will need some guarantee in the form of a bufferstate to keep the two great powers at some distance. Establishing an independent and neutral Normandy may do the trick."
  PB_CoE_A_Small_Occitan_State:0 "The Pau-Toulouse-Nimes Concept"
  PB_CoE_A_Small_Occitan_State_desc:0 "A German-French state with a Mediterranean border may be too much of a threat to the British navy in the region and its hold on North Africa, keeping the British diplomats with their hands tied on our proposed merger. While the establishment of an independent Occitania in Southern France may calm their nerves, we shouldn't be willing to completely abandon this important region of France. A small Occitania will have to do."
  PB_CoE_A_Large_Occitan_State:0 "Implement the Pan-Occitan Dream"
  PB_CoE_A_Large_Occitan_State_desc:0 "Southern France is a culture distinct from the urban jungle of Paris or the Anglo-Celtic fusion of cultures in the regions that were occupied by the Brits during the medieval era. Recognising this basic principle, Germany and Britain agree to the establishment of a fully independent Occitan state, encompassing all Occitan states stretching from the Pyrenees to the Italian border."
  PB_CoE_Occitania_of_both_Seas:0 "The Intermarium Concept"
  PB_CoE_Occitania_of_both_Seas_desc:0 "While strong, Occitania still needs more leverage on the international stage for the British to agree to our ambitious proposal. The Intermarium concept, coined by Bohemian thinker Jan Masaryk, proposes an Occitan state that borders both the Mediterranean and Atlantic, allowing it more options for a relationship with the British without the danger of isolation in the event of conflict in the Mediterranean."
  PB_CoE_France_in_Europe:0 "France's Place in Europe?"
  PB_CoE_France_in_Europe_desc:0 "While the German government has gone down the path of unifying the European continent under an unique federation of equal Europeans, the place of France in this new idea of Europe remains a question. Many former enemies of Paris are reluctant to allow the French any kind of equal status in this European confederation, but some have shown far more sympathy for France's place in this new global order. A few proposals are on the table."
  PB_CoE_Schwarz_Plan:0 "Implementing the Schwarz Plan"
  PB_CoE_Schwarz_Plan_desc:0 "France goes bye bye"
  PB_CoE_Italo_Franco_Border:0 "Redrawing the Franco-Italian Border"
  PB_CoE_Italo_Franco_Border_desc:0 "Our French ally has bled casualties during this war and now, stirred on by public opinion and the monarchy, is seeking to gain from the conflict. Specifically, the region of Provence has gained the interest of Italy, as an economically viable region with enough potential during reconstruction."
  PB_CoE_Question_of_Corsica:0 "Question of Corsica"
  PB_CoE_Question_of_Corsica_desc:0 "Having faced occupation by the French, the island of Corsica has become a small question mark in our larger treaty on France. Who is to govern over this little island of the coast of France and Italy? Is it better to restore the sovereign monarchy of the Bonapartes or award the island to an allied great power in the region?"
  PB_CoE_The_Parisian_Government:0 "New Parisian Government"
  PB_CoE_The_Parisian_Government_desc:0 "The French occupation authority is only made to be temporary, so a big question remains in the air during the conference: what kind of regime is to be imposed upon the French after their revanchist one? \n\nThe main two options seem to be a new Republican form of government or a constitutional monarchy without the Bourbons. A republic, while potentially a great boon for a flourishing French democracy in the future, was also the form of government that allowed Doriot and his party to perverse democracy into the revanchist threat we faced. A monarchy, meanwhile, may face new problems and could be seriously unpopular among the French people." 
  PB_CoE_Fate_of_Algeria:0 "Fate of Algeria"
  PB_CoE_Fate_of_Algeria_desc:0 "The French acquired the colony of Algeria after the Pied-Noir found themselves victorious during the civil conflict in the region. They longed to unify the old colony to the mainland and were under the Parisian thumb during the Second Great War. Now, we're facing a seriously complex situation. While the Pied-Noir are still loyal to Paris, the majority native population of Algeria would rather be governed by themselves, as an independent republic. The British, meanwhile, still prefer to return Algeria as a part of the Empire."

  PB_CoE_Spanish_Division:0 "Dividing the Peninsula"
  PB_CoE_Spanish_Division_desc:0 "Spain has been an antagonistic force in European affairs for far too long now. One of the main castles of Bourbon influence in Europe, the Spanish Empire and its later iterations have dragged Europe time and time again into war. It is only right for us to rectify this mistake and divide the country into its fundamental parts, along community lines, and establish independent states that serve the interests of the League of Nations."
  PB_CoE_Spanish_Reconstruction:0 "Renew the Spanish Monarchy"
  PB_CoE_Spanish_Reconstruction_desc:0 "Under their luddite government, the Spanish saw a revival of monarchist nostalgia emerge among the middle and upper classes, informing government policy and the eventual decision to join the French in their crusade against the status quo. While we have defeated the monarch-friendly government, we haven't defeated the monarch-friendly people. It is perhaps in our best interest to restore the Spanish crown, but not under a Bourbon. Instead, a monarch that is willing to cooperate with Berlin and London is the better choice for the Spanish crown."
  PB_CoE_Pan_Occitan_State:0 "Catalan-Occitan Unification"
  PB_CoE_Pan_Occitan_State_desc:0 "With the recent setting up of an Occitan state on the Spanish border, an interesting proposal has been made by local intellectuals from Occitania. They have proven that Occitan culture is rather similair to Catalan culture, insisting that the two should be united under a single government with the recent establishment of Occitania. While some seem to disagree with their assertion, especially Catalan nationalists, Britain has been chearleeding the initiative."
  PB_CoE_Reestablish_Euskadi:0 "Bulwark Euskadi?"
  PB_CoE_Reestablish_Euskadi_desc:0 "Bearing the brunt of French and Spanish aggression, the Basque people have proven their capability in their resistance of both tyrannical governments, preserving their unique culture and democracy in the face of incredible odds. Now, the question remains of the future of the Basque people. Is restoration enough or do we have to prop up a proper bulwark for future expansionism?" 

  PB_CoE_Plan_Cavour:0 "Discuss the Cavour Plan"
  PB_CoE_Plan_Cavour_desc:0 "For the second time this decade, Italy has betrayed its own national interest and instead followed the interest of France once more, proving the state to be a dangerous experiment that needs to be undone. The Cavour Plan is designed to solve the Italian issue, proposing the dissolution of Italy as a way to finally solve Italy's shaky place in Europe and put the Italian people under the supervision of the League of Nations."
  PB_CoE_Extend_Monaco_Protection:0 "Monaco's Place in the Sun"
  PB_CoE_Extend_Monaco_Protection_desc:0 "Like the Benelux region existing as a roadblock between the French and the Germans, buffer states tend to be a good solution to limit the chances of hostility. In the case of Italy, however, it doesn't really have any kind of buffer between its bordering major powers. A proposal is thus been requested by the delegation from Monaco, suppported by the German delegation, insisting upon the expansion of Monaco's territory, including the city of Nice. By expanding the gambling state, Monaco may act as a defensive bulwark for both Italian and French aggression."
  PB_CoE_Aosta_Valley:0 "The Troubling Aosta Valley"
  PB_CoE_Aosta_Valley_desc:0 "The Aosta Valley has been a sour point between France and Italy for a rather long time. A serious plan needs to be drawn up to fix this issue."   
 
  PB_CoE_Transitional_Government_Poland:0 "Appoint a Warsaw Government"
  PB_CoE_Transitional_Government_Poland_desc:0 "With the transitional government in place in the former Russian territory of Poland, a decision needs to be made on the future of Poland as a state. The choice is simple: Poland will either adopt a monarchy or become a liberal republic."
  PB_CoE_Reviving_the_Commonwealth:0 "Reviving the Commonwealth Concept"
  PB_CoE_Establish_the_Intermarium:0 "Establish the Międzymorze"
  PB_CoE_Courland_Question:0 "Courland Question"
  PB_CoE_Courland_Question_desc:0 "Courland has been historically associated with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Should we return this piece of Baltic coast to the Commonwealth or allow it to decide its own fate later?"
  PB_CoE_Prussian_Question:0 "The East Prussian Question"
  PB_CoE_Belarus_Question:0 "Revisiting the Polish-Ruthenian Border"
  PB_CoE_Memel_Question:0 "The Memel Question"

  PB_CoE_Hold_a_Referendum:0 "Hold a Baltic Referendum"
  PB_CoE_Hold_a_Referendum_desc:0 "With the liberation of the Baltic people from Russian oppression, a serious question must be answered: how will the future of the Baltics be shaped? Entangled in the politics of their bordering countries, including Finland, Poland, Russia and Germany, the Baltics are an important part in the European puzzle and thus a high priority for the Conference of Europe." 
  PB_CoE_Prop_Up_Baltic_Federation:0 "Prop up a Baltic State"
  PB_CoE_Prop_Up_Baltic_Federation_desc:0 "While the idea of a referendum has been floating around for a while, the Baltics are far too important to weaken through national sovereign states independent from Riga. German forces thus need to prop up a strong Baltic state, presumably with support from local authoritarians for a future confrontation with the Russians." 
  PB_CoE_Discussing_Wilno:0 "Treating the Wilno Issue"
  PB_CoE_Discussing_Wilno_desc:0 "Wilno/Vilnius has become a sensitive issue for the Baltic region. Several people claim the region, including Belarus, Poland and Lithuania. An answer is needed: who will govern this controversial region?" 
  PB_CoE_Add_to_the_Intermarium:0 "Include the Baltic in the Międzymorze"
  PB_CoE_Add_to_the_Intermarium_desc:0 "The establishment of the Międzymorze in Poland has attracted attention in the Baltics. The idea of a strong Eastern European state able to defend itself against future Russian imperialism, made up from old Commonwealth nations is intrigueing to some. While nationalists decry the idea of joining a nation with the Polish, elements inside the Baltics and the delegations present at the Conference may look more favourably on a strong Eastern Europe."
  PB_CoE_Estonian_Petition_for_Union:0 "The Estonian Petition"
  PB_CoE_Estonian_Petition_for_Union_desc:0 "It has only been mere weeks since Estonia has gained its independence, yet the government in Talinn has already petitioned the Conference to look into the matter of unifying Estonia with Finland. Finnish-Estonian unionism isn't a new concept, gaining ground in the 19th century during the peak of Russification and only expanding in popularity during Finland's war of independence against the Russians. For a long time, Estonian leaders have looked up to Finland as a bigger brother in many matters and this union would solidify their position on the matter."

  PB_CoE_Form_a_Belarussian_Government:0 "Appoint a Minsk Government"
  PB_CoE_Form_a_Belarussian_Government_desc:0 "The interim occupation government of Belarus has lived out its use and soon a more native government will need to be appointed to placate the population. Serious questions need to be answered about the future of Belarus, as the delegations have turned the topic controversial. Ideas ranging from democracy and monarchy to propping up a local dictator instead have been proposed, with the unifying fear being that the Belarusian people will soon try and unite again with the Russian people given the chance. Can a democracy placate them into the European sphere or can only the hard hand of monarchy or dictatorship keep the Belarusian people under our strict control."
  PB_CoE_Integrate_Belarus_with_Warsaw:0 "Include Belarus in the Międzymorze"
  PB_CoE_Integrate_Belarus_with_Warsaw_desc:0 "-"

  PB_CoE_Solidify_Caucasian_Unity:0 "Establish a Unitary Caucasus"
  PB_CoE_Solidify_Caucasian_Unity_desc:0 "While native voices inside the Caucasian mandate have been rather vocal about their support for total independence of their respective homelands, the delegations remain sceptical about the prospect. Dividing the Caucasus is a recipe for interstate conflict and ethnic tension, so the decision has been made to formalize the international mandate in Tblisi into a unified state." 
  PB_CoE_Disunite_the_Region:0 "Dissolve the CIM"
  PB_CoE_Disunite_the_Region_desc:0 "The Caucasian International Mandate has ran its course and, with the voice of independence growing louder, the Caucasus should be divided along ethnic lines. Armenians, Georgians and Azeris all seek to establish their independence and we should hear them out." 
  PB_CoE_Grant_Ankara_Armenia:0 "Grant Ankara an Armenian Mandate"
  PB_CoE_Grant_Ankara_Armenia_desc:0 "Having tested the waters for a while, the Turks have finally come to the Conference with the proposal of granting them a mandate over the admnistration of Armenia. Practically turning the new independent state into a puppet of Osman, granting the Turks the mandate would fulfill their desires over some Caucasian control and may be a good way to placate the Osman delegation."

  COE.1.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Main Course"
  COE.1.d:0 "As diplomats and heads of government and state gather around the packed hallways of Het Loo Palace, so graciously proposed to be the site of this historical conference by the Dutch crown, the conference slowly gets started. In a sideroom, not that noticeable when walking through the palace, the major players have started the conference with its main course: France. \n\nThe undoubted aggressor of this war, France acts like a mirror for many older diplomats in the room, reflecting upon the hasty decisions made in the aftermath of the first Great War that allowed for such a monster like Doriot to firmly grasp the wheel of the failed Republic. Among British diplomats, who seek to find an eternal solution to the continent's war problem, the old treaty is the perfect example of how not to go forward. Germany, on the other hand, has been the nation that suffered the most from the French invasion, with their border regions destroyed and their economy turned on its head after such an expensive war. Millions of marks in debt and the lives of many men lost, Germany's diplomats resent the British approach to the situation. In their eyes, the solution to France is clear: dismantlement. The degrees vary, but most German diplomats are keen on the idea of breaking the French spirit completely. \n\nAs papers are put on the round table and the big faces of Europe start speaking, the Conference of Europe has truly started."
  COE.1.a:0 "Hopefully, peace will be given a chance"
  COE.2.t:0 "Conference of Europe: France and Europe"
  COE.2.d:0 "With the continued effort of the German government to found upon the new world order a federation of European states, the question of France has continued to echo loudly through the halls of Het Loo. While the European project is defined by the united feeling of post-war stress and a new concept of Europeaness based on liberal democracy, Europeans like the French simply do not fit the same concept as the aggressors of the war. \n\nStill, a concept is on the table to divide the region of Burgundy into its own state and allow it to remain under the German wing. The argument mainly rests upon the idea of further weakening France's position, though it may worsen the narrative upon which the European project is being build upon."
  COE.2.a:0 "We can be European without the French"
  COE.2.b:0 "A German-aligned Burgundy is a perfectly fine concept"
  COE.3.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Schwarz Proposal"
  COE.3.d:0 "Out of nowhere, the German delegation has backed a proposal written by German bureaucrat Franz Xaver Schwarz, deemed so radical that it has even taken the Turkish delegation aback. Schwarz is a known German ideologue, famed for his intellectual argumentation of anti-French sentiment. Using history and culture, Schwarz argues that the French have been a nation of expansionism since its inception and that it has to cease existing for peace in Europe to be viable. \n\nThe proposal pictures an Europe without France. The country is instead divided into its \"medieval\" parts, dividing the country among a Republic of the Seine, a Burgundian Kingdom, a Normandian state and a Southern Occitania. While Schwarz himself has gone even further, advocating for complete deindustrialisation and \"turning the clock back in France\", German diplomats still know how to be diplomatic and have thus kept those ideas out of the final draft. Still, the concept to the British delegation seems beyond unreasonable."
  COE.3.a:0 "Francia delenda est!"
  COE.4.t:0 "State turns Pastoral"
  COE.4.d:0 "The deindustrialization policy imposed upon us has hit another region of our country, as it becomes more bare and more people leave the region, hoping to find opportunities elsewhere."
  COE.4.a:0 "Devestation, oh devestation..."
  COE.5.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Franco-German Border"
  COE.5.d:0 "With millions and millions of casualties in this war, it is no surprise that some countries have come to the conference with a vengeance against the French state. One of these delegations is from our ally in Naples, which saw thousands of its own people slaughtered during the conflict. Now, stirred on by public opinion and the opinion of the royal court, the Italian delegation has proposed a redrawing of the border shared by France and Italy. \n\nIt is clear that the Italian delegation seeks repayment for the crimes committed by the French, but the question does remain on how much we can give to our Italian ally."
  COE.5.a:0 "War reparations, that will be all..."
  COE.5.b:0 "Grant them Savoy"
  COE.5.c:0 "Follow the Rhone Proposal"
  COE.6.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Corsica"
  COE.6.d:0 "The bizarre island of Corsica has, like many Francophone nations, been the victim of French revanchism during the war. Under Paris, Corsican culture experienced attempts at purification and turning it more French and the ruling monarchy of the island nation, the Bonapartes, were exiled by French forces. \n\nIt is now up to the Conference to decide who to grant the territory. While it may seem clear that the old Corsican regime is the only legitimate claimant to the island, both Italy and the UK have also expressed interests in the small island. Italy backs its claim by a historical basis, as Corsica was dominated by the merchant republic of Genoa during the medieval era. Britain, on the other hand, seeks to gain Corsica as a base of operation, granting the Brits another port in the Mediterranean."
  COE.6.a:0 "Restore the old government of Corsica"
  COE.6.b:0 "Grant the Italians the island"
  COE.6.c:0 "Grant the British the island"

  COE.x.t:0 "Conference of Europe: The Dexter Plan"
  COE.x.d:0 "Drawn up and proposed by famed Commonwealth economists Harry Dexter White and Henry Morgenthau, the Dexter Plan reeks of British influence. Proposing to minimize the partition of France, the Dexter Plan draws up a map of the pre-expansion borders of France, excluding the region around Dunkerque, which is given to Walloon state. The plan further details several industrial occupation zones across the country, mainly meant to keep France's heavy industrial capabilities under the watchful eyes of the League of Nations. \n\nWhile a subtle and highly technical plan that promises peace on the continent, the German diplomats have been far less enthusiastic about the proposed plan than their British counterparts. Perhaps the plan can use some revision, but it is currently the proposal we put on the table."
  COE.x.a:0 "Let the vote begin..."
  COE.x.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Rathenau's Francia" 
  COE.x.d:0 "An interesting proposal has been put forward by the German delegation at Palace Het Loo. Concluding that Europe has been a continent plagued with wars for over decades at this point, often motivated through national competition and international anarchy, Rathenau's proposal has proposed the unification of the French and German states into one, collosal Frankenstein state. Inspired by the Empire of Charlemagne of the early medieval era, Rathenau coined the name \"Francia\" for his ambitious project of Franco-German unity. \n\nThe proposal has been met with skepticism by British diplomats, but the sudden relaxed tone from the German diplomats has forced the Brits into an interesting position: while unorthodox, this proposal is perhaps the best the UK will get in terms of a German-approved proposal that guarantees continental peace."
  COE.x.a:0 "Let the vote begin..."

  COE.7.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Burgundy"
  COE.7.d:0 "Historically once part of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgundy is perhaps the region closest to Germany in many ways. A rural chunk of Eastern France, Burgundy may prove an useful puppet in the coming years. \n\nThe British have limited interests in the region, so they will not mind us taking this region."
  COE.7.a:0 "We will take Burgundy then"
  COE.7.b:0 "Let's establish it as a neutral bufferstate instead"
  COE.8.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Normandy"
  COE.8.d:0 "Normandy, due to its coast on the English Channel and historical connections to the British, has been part of a larger British vision for quite some time now. If we'd give them this small piece of land, we can expect the British to be far more interested in our proposal."
  COE.8.a:0 "Actually, German Normandy sounds right, you know?"
  COE.8.b:0 "Let's placate the Brits with a bit of Normandy"
  COE.9.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Occitania"
  COE.9.d:0 "The Southern region of France, Occitania is a state with a similar, yet different culture from North France. With a long history of persecution under the Parisian regime, Occitania isn't the most popular of ideas among locals, but is good enough of an excuse to establish a separate state with. \n\nSpecifically Italy has been interested in the region of Occitania, but the British may also want to rule the region, due to its Mediterranean coast, allowing for easy shipping to their North African colonies."
  COE.9.a:0 "A nice, sunny coast is perfect for German interests!"
  COE.9.b:0 "The Brits can have their Mediterranean coast"
  COE.9.c:0 "The Italians can use some territory"
  COE.10.t:0 "Dividing the Pie: Republic of the Seine"
  COE.10.d:0 "An artificial creation born out of the end of the second Great War's treaties, the Republic of the Seine is mainly important due to their Atlantic coast. The Bordeaux port may proof an excellent base for any Atlantic navy, so the British have been very keen on getting this particular piece of France. German diplomats have also shown interest, as the Bordeaux port may proof a good start for a German deep sea navy. \n\nWith conflict between German and British diplomats over this piece of land brewing, a solution may be necessary."
  COE.10.a:0 "We will take this coast for ourselves"
  COE.10.b:0 "Grant them the region..."
  COE.10.c:0 "The Brits can have it, but we will have Paris"
  COE.10.e:0 "We will take Bordeaux, the Brits can have Paris"

  COE.20.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Ending the France Debate"
  COE.20.d:0 "A few exasperated sighs filled the small room in Palace Het Loo, as diplomats and government figures neatly compiled their papers once again into their briefcases. The first round of discussions had concluded and the topic of France was settled. \n\nAs coffee, tea and some light celebratory wine was offered to the many men standing in the halls of Het Loo, the fate of Europe was closer to being further constructed."
  COE.20.a:0 "And the curtains close on this debate"
  COE.21.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Wallonia demands Reparations"
  COE.21.d:0 "As the conference started, one of the first delegations to loudly declare its national victimhood was from Wallonia. Despite the general sentiment among the diplomats at the conference that large parts of Walloon society wasn't opposed to French unification, the Walloon delegation was given the same patience and attention as every other delegation. During their time, they declared the horrors of French occupation to have been of exceptional degree in Wallonia, allowing the Walloon delegation to demand serious reparations from France. \n\nThe negotations about these reparations have gone from industrial reparations to even territory, but a conclusion has yet to be found."
  COE.21.a:0 "We won't give these \"victims\" anything"
  COE.21.b:0 "They will have to be happy with reparations"
  COE.21.c:0 "Grant them the Pas de Calais"
  COE.22.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Jewish Victims Fund"
  COE.22.d:0 "The war has had an immense impact on every European, soldier and civilian alike. However, certain groups of people have suffered excessive discrimination, persecution and worse under the French regime. Both the delegation of European Jews as the delegation of the zionist organization have had their time during the conference too, both describing the extreme measures of the French dictatorship against European jews, backed by various international humanist organizations and the information gathered by imperial divisions that liberated Alpine work camps. \n\nThe question now seems to be if giving the Jewish people a homeland is enough, or if a serious reparation fund needs to be placed on the French government for its inhumane treatment of its Jewish citizens and other Jewish civilians during the war."
  COE.22.a:0 "We can't place too much burden on the French..."
  COE.22.b:0 "The French will pay for their crimes"
  COE.23.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Madrid's Role"
  COE.23.d:0 "With the end of the debate on France, the delegations of the League of Nations have fixed their gaze on Spain, one of France's main allies during the conflict. Spain has supported the French in their revanchist goals for a second time during this century and are thus a serious problem which needs a serious solution. \n\nLearning from the failure of the Spanish Republic in the aftermath of the First Great War, Spain isn't expected to be turned into a second republic again by most delegations. Both the German and British delegations seem to prefer an aligned monarch on the throne, though it remains to be seen how the Spanish people would react to such development. Whatever the future may hold, Spain will suffer the consequences of its loyalty to Paris."

  COE.31.d:0 "Named after the old Count of Cavour, Camillo Benso, who opposed Italian unification under the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies, the Cavour Plan is the topic of debate that is raging through Palace het Loo. Few if any representatives are truly sure what to do with the Italian peninsula after its turn against the League of Nations and its support for French aggression. Many British diplomats argue that the support for France was unnatural, forced by French intervention and not a true expression of Italy's desire during the war. The nation was basically a hostage, forced by Paris to do its bidding. A few German representatives and the diplomats hailing from the Balkan nations disagree heavily with this assesement. \n\nThe opposition thus proposed the Cavour Plan, seeking to end the Italian project and dissolve the nation back into its original nation-states. A less aggressive version of the plan simply divides the nation into two blocs, a northern kingdom under German influence and a southern kingdom that is subject to British interests. Most British diplomats are, however, not keen on dividing the kingdom and still support lesser punishements for Italy than the dissolution of their nation."

  COE.32.d:0 "An extremely tiny issue has come over the table in the Loo. Monaco, a small principality on the coast of the Mediterranean, was in some forms an initial victim of Italian aggression. The occupation of the small city state has led some to believe that it is better for Europe and for the future to grant Monaco the surrounding area of Nice, bolstering the small state a bit in the face of any future conflict. Opponents of the plan have been sceptical about the proposed expansion of Monaco, with a select few even accussing the proposing diplomat of having personal stakes in Monaco's banking system. He, of course, has fervently denied such accusations."

  COE.33.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Aosta Valley"
  COE.33.d:0 "The Aosta Valley has been a point contention between Italy and France since Italian unification, with both countries claiming the region as an inherent part of their country. The region's dubious place in international politics has thus attracted the attention of the League and an answer is needed if peace is to be preserved. Possible candidates for the region range from the two claiming nations to Switzerland as a neutral state between France and Italy. Whoever we may give the region, we should be willing to enforce their claim in the case of future conflict."

  COE.42.t:0 "The Next King of Poland?"
  COE.42.d:0 "With the selection of a parliamentary monarchy as government form, Poland still needs to answer one question: which monarch will become the figurehead of the Polish people? A real Polish line has become lacking this decade, with many old Polish aristocrats dying out during the wars.

  COE.43.t:0 "First Polish Parliamentary Election"
  COE.43.d:0 "As the Sjem, the parliament of Polish democracy, is being build in the former Russian palace of Warsaw, the ballot-boxes have been put in place for the first election. Young parties have popped up out of the anti-Russian resistance cells that once fought for Polish independence, all split on their specific ideological views on Poland's future. The most prominent of these groups is the ghost of Galicia himself, Józef Piłsudski, leader of the revolutionary agrarian party, despite his sickness. His reputation has become the status of legends among Polish partisans, as Piłsudski's raids from Hungary into Galicia against Russian outposts kept morale high in the independence movement. Across from the Galician ghost stands a similar, though lesser known, figure: Eligiusz Niewiadomski. Having taken over control of the National Democrats after the death of Roman Dmowski in '32 at the hands of the Russians, Niewiadomski also operated in Galicia as a smuggler of nationalist propaganda. His ideology, however, turns him into a staunch opponent of Pilsudski's revolutionary ideas, with Niewiadomski promoting anti-anarchism, christian nationalism and anti-Jewish legislation. \n\nKeeping these fringes in check are both the liberals and the conservatives, which both seem to shape Polish politics into a two party plus system. The liberal Peasants Party of Gabriel J. Narutowicz and the Republican Union of Stanisław Grabski are shaping up to become the main competitors of this election, but it remains uncertain if they can keep the fringes from making a surprising victory in this first election."

  COE.44.d:0 "The border between the two new states of Poland and Belarus have been a topic of furious debate. With the unclear ethnic diversity of the region as a result of years and years of Russian interference, there is no clear border to be drawn that will appease every community. The Polish delegation and Belarussian delegation have thus drawn up two proposals: \n\nBelarus has proposed that, if they're forced to cede territory, that it would depart with its Russopolish majority regions. The delegation states that Poland has only a legitimate claim to this region of Belarus, as it holds a majority of people that are close to the Polish culture and community instead of the Belarussian one. \n\nThe Polish delegation, spurred on by nationalists at home, have proposed a rather radical option, which forces Belarus to cede its Russopolish parts and the Wilno-Vilnius region. Despite these parts housing a Belarussian majority, the Polish delegation claims the territory as historically important to Poland. \n\nWith which plan do we go?"
  COE.44.a:0 "Adopt the Belarussian Plan"

  COE.44.c:0 "Adopt the Polish Plan"
  COE.45.t:0 "Conference of Europe: East Prussia"
  COE.45.d:0 "East Prussia isn't really German, despite its similarities. The uniquely Prussian culture of the region has given the region a bad reputation in the United Kingdom of Germany as a backwards place, holding backwards ideas and having a backwards culture of junkers and slaves. Poland, on the other hand, has an inherent interest in the region due to the Polish population that it houses and housed before the previous regime's population transfer policies and the connection to the sea East Prussia promises. Several proposals have been made, but it remains unclear what the best course of action is."
  COE.45.a:0 "We will keep the region German for now..."

  COE.46.d:0 "The Baltics have been Russian for a similar amount of time as the Polish, but have faced a larger share of the Russofication policy under the Empire. large swathes of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania now talk Russian and are more loyal to Moscow than to any Baltic state. Their situation isn't the only precarious thing, as the Baltic union that we've temporarily set up is also fairing badly. A referendum is thus planned to be held in the next few months, which will clear up the will of the Baltic people and how they want to continue through history."

  COE.49.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Memel"
  COE.49.d:0 "This slip of land between Prussia and Lithuania, named after the river of the same name, is a wanted piece of land in Eastern Europe. The Lithuanian states of the past have often claimed the small strip as ancestral Lithuanian lands, while Germans in the region have often sought to control the strip of land for their own benefit, like the Teutonic order or other christian warriors of old. Now, however, the strip of land is mainly important for its symbolic value. Shall we grant this strip to the Lithuanians or give it to the Germans?"

  COE.53.d:0 "With the failure to agree upon the establishment of a Jewish state in France, Zionist advocates have once again reached out to the delegations present at the Conference and asked for the establishment of a state for their people in the recently occupied Prussian provinces. \n\nWhile an incredibly odd suggestion and one that has divided even the Zionist world itself, the British delegation has seemingly been very warm to the idea of a Prussian Israel, though with the noted criteria that the existing Prussian people would be respected in their human rights. Germany hasn't made much noise about the prospect, but experts do seem to believe that the more liberal elements of German society would not mind, noting that the Prussian people are only seen as part of the \"proper German\" family by a branch of pan-Germanists. However, that does not guarantee Germany's cooperation."

Without the necessary measures, the Armenian Republic is afraid that it may be endangered by Turkish ambition\". \n\nThe speech by the Armenian delegation has clearly upset the Turks, but has been met with civilized applause by the rest of the Conference. Demilitarization of the region would be a fantastic compromise to the question, as it would grant the Turks the region but would preserve its Armenian population through close monitoring by the League. Armenia's request is rather rare in its moderation and must be seriously examined."

  COE.62.t:0 "Conference of Europe: Armenian Mandate"

The silence was short-lived, as the Armenian delegation immediately protested such action, declaring that the League sought to defeat imperialism, not support it. The situation demands an answer, as the two sides will not be able to find any common ground on this issue."

The map of Europe has been drastically redrawn, establishing new states, republics and kingdoms, all as members of the League of Nations, in the hope of establishing an eternal peace on the continent. For once, our nations may know rest instead of war, plowshares instead of swords and fraternity instead of hostility. The cancer of neo-imperialism will have to be removed over decades, if not centuries, of delicate politics, but Europe may win the ultimate price of our forever peace. \n\nAs the last promises are made and some names are hastily drawn under this special treaty, the room erupts into applause. Diplomats sigh and shake some hands before leaving Palace the Loo for good. Europe has changed, hopefully for the better."

  COEDEXTER.1.d:0 "As British diplomats seek to further placate us with their Dexter Plan, the proposal of German diplomats to carve some territory away from France and give it to the Jewish people has been given the green light by the Brits. The Jewish people have suffered immensely under the French dictatorship, seeing themselves stripped from citizenship, property and sometimes their lives. The least we can do is come together and repay the Jewish people, a globally persecuted people, with their own homeland in France. \n\nThe question now remains which French state to grant the Jewish people. Preferably, the territory has a coast and isn't already claimed by another country."
  
  COEGOV.1.t:0 "Formalizing a Normandian Government"
  COEGOV.1.d:0 "With the establishment of an independent Normandy, a country that hasn't been a country since the age of Vikings, the question of government has been raised among the diplomats in Het Loo. The main problem is the exact type of government: will Normandy adhere to a monarch or be established as a republic? While the idea of a monarchy is interesting to many diplomats, the question of a king may proof to be difficult, especially after France's long experiment with Republicanism. The establishment of a Normandian Republic may prove more worthwile, as long as it is handled correctly and any member of the previous dictatorship is barred from holding office in the new republic."

  COEGOV.4.t:0 "The Tale of the Iron Crown"
  COEGOV.4.d:0 "Supposedly forged out of the iron nails used to crucify Christ the Lord himself, the Iron Crown of Lombardy has become an artifact that has traveled the continent in a short span of time. When Italy fell, the crown suddenly vanished out of Lombardy, but was quickly found in the streets of Vienna. Since then, the crown became property of the German state. \n\nWith the establishment of an independent North Italian kingdom under the rule of Peter Ferdinand, a Habsburg relative, the situation of the Iron Crown has been turned into a question once more. Pietro, an avid Italophile and catholic fanatic, has sought to restore the Iron Crown to his new kingdom, hoping to form a new identity in the North of Italy around the legendary kinds of Lombardy, the mercantile exploits of Venice and the artistic ways of Tuscany."

  COEGOV.4.b:0 "A museum would be a proper place for this thing" 
  COEGOV.6.t:0 "Unrest in the Baltic State"
  COEGOV.6.d:0 "The propping up of an authoritarian government in the Baltics has been met with enormous popular resistance. The Baltic people have been dissapointed in the League of Nations, seeing the replacement of a brutal authoritarian system of governance with a new authoritarian system of governance instead of the promised Western democracy. The establishment of the Ulmanis government has sparked the flame from which the Baltic Liberation Front has sprung out of, a multinational organization designed to be a barrier to the new authoritarian regime. More nationalistic assocations have also sprung up, seeking to end the artificial Baltic state and establish their own national authoritarian states, independent from the League of Nations and its freemason influences. \n\nUlmanis seems to be able to handle the situation with our continued support, but his position has become delicate. Pulling out of the region would seriously threaten the friendly regime of Riga."
  COEGOV.6.a:0 "An unfortunate development..."  
  COEGOV.7.t:0 "The Russo-Baltic Explusion"
  COEGOV.7.d:0 "The authoritarian Ulmanis of the Baltic State has followed through with what was initially expected to be empty rethoric, forcing families of Russo-Baltic origin to cross the border into wartorn Russia, seizing property from those families and redistributing them to poorer natives. The brutality of this policy has been heavily criticized by the international community after the sudden realization of what was happening in the Baltics, but Germany and Britain have also been facing major criticism for their role. Beyond enabling Ulmanis with unlimited presidential power and setting up his government, British and German troops actively did not intervene against Baltic police and soldiers and simply observed the violent expulsion. \n\nThe only region of the Baltics that still has a majority of Russo-Baltic natives is Saaremaa, as the islands have become a serious point of agitation against the Riga regime and the Baltic partisans, forming organizations sympathetic to the old Russian neo-imperialist regime and advocating for annexation with the Purishkevich administration."
  COEGOV.7.a:0 "The Baltics grow tenser and tenser..." 

  COEGOV.12.t:0 "Monarch of the Caucasus"
  COEGOV.12.d:0 "With the choice of establishing a monarchist regime in the Caucasian region, the question now remains who intends to rule these diverse lands. Georgia has had a rather recent history of monarchist claimants and families tracing their lineage back to the Georgian kingdom of history, while Armenia itself has to do with foreign claimants to the throne of Armenia, often through rather obscure claims made during the late medieval era. Azerbaijan itself also has some members of nobility who may rule as wise monarchs, but the Conference has explicitly chosen for a christian monarch of the Caucasian Mountains. \n\nPerhaps the claimant with the most legitimacy is prince Teymuraz of the house Bagration, who currently resides in the American Commonwealth. As current head of the Bagration family after many men of the house died during the Second Great War, Teymuraz can claim prestige through his ancient lineage and has been pushed by the British delegation as the perfect candidate for the region. \n\nThe German delegation for its part has pushed for Anton von Habsburg, who can trace his claim to the kingdom of Armenia to James II of Cyprus. A claim that was already dubious when it was made in the late 1400s has raised even more eyebrows now in the 20th century, with some delegations viewing the German choice as a rather blatant way to get another Habsburg on another throne. Germany denies this however, maintaining that Anton is very likely the only legitimate claimant of the kingdom of Armenia and thus is a possible option for Caucasian kingship. \n\nThe last option has been proposed by the Armenian delegation itself: Charlotte de La Trémoille, a small noble from France who represents a small pretender claim to the Kingdom of Italy, but can also trace a claim to the Armenian crown back to the kingdom of Cyprus and the role the house of La Trémoïlle played during the crusade. Not only has the Armenian delegation represented her as a compromise candidate that promises no special treatment to any of the great powers, but also as the most popular pick among the Armenian people, holding a charming sway that few can deny."
  COEGOV.12.a:0 "Teymuraz has the most ancient claim"

With the banners of the cross and Christ flying once more in Portugal, the monarchy has been put into exile once more, this time fleeing to London. \n\nThe defeat of the League-supported monarchy by the betrayed Fatamists has become an early crack in the post-war European design envisioned by Germany and Britain.

  PB_Constitutionally_Enshrined_Neutrality:0 "International Neutrality"
  PB_Constitutionally_Enshrined_Neutrality_desc:0 "The neutrality of this nation is enshrined in its constitution and the treaty that established this country. Recognised by the international community, the neutrality of this nation is almost sacred."
  PB_Purged_Administration:0 "Purged Bureaucracy"
  PB_Purged_Administration_desc:0 "As part of the peace treaty, many figures of the previous government were barred from holding public office during their lifetime, seriously draining the pool of capable bureaucrats, politicians and diplomats in our country. It will take some time before inexperienced state employees can rise to the same level of expertise as the previous administration."

  PB_War_Reps_Dynamic_Modifier:0 "War Reparations"
  PB_War_Reps_Dynamic_Modifier_desc:0 "This nation has been absolutely defeated during the Second Great War and is now forced to pay for its destruction. Every month, the reserves are slowly growing more empty as the bill for destroyed buildings, smoking craters, civilian suffering and more is imposed on this country."

  RANIERI_DESC:0 "Italy has been defeated, dismantled and decimated. Sons and fathers have died and widows are all that are left. Germany and Britain, filled with a need for revenge against the aggressors of the second Great War, took Italy's destiny from its own hands and chained the Italian people to artificial creations, such as the new Kingdom of Two Sicilies. The recent crowning of king Ranieri I came when his brother, Ferdinand Pius, refused to rule over this artificial creation of a kingdom, stating that he would only represent the Italian people and not any bastardized form of this concept. Ranieri was the second choice, pressured by the British to accept the crown and rule this petty fiefdom as nothing more than a puppet of London. \n\nSecluded to his luxurious palaces in Naples, Ranieri can only watch as the incompetent government appointed by the Brits after the peace struggle to reconstruct the South of Italy after the war. Poverty, famine and disease plague these lands, which he may call himself a petty king of. A petty king, with petty aspirations, sitting in his petty castle." 
  PIETRO_DESC:0 "Following in the footsteps of the kings of medieval Northern Italy, claimant to the Iron Crown of Lombardy, Pietro II is far from as mythical as these kings. A relative to the German king, Peter Ferdinand changed his name to Pietro to emulate the habsburgs of Tuscany before him, claiming a mantle that has limited attachment to him personally. \n\nPietro II is a king more hated than loved. A foreign replacement imposed on the proud people of Northern Italy, roleplaying as an Italian monarch while disrespecting the symbols of Northern Italy, such as the Iron Crown and the legacy of the Lombardian people. It remains to be seen how long Pietro II can remain in power."
