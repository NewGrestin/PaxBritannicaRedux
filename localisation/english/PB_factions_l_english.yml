  FACTION_IMPERIAL_POWERS:0 "§YMember of the Imperial Powers Alliance§!"
  FACTION_IMPERIAL_POWERS_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YImperial Powers§!, the remnant of the Anglo-German Alliance during the Great War. Founded originally by the German Empire, the leadership of the Imperial Powers shifted towards London following the end of hostilities and the European Economic Crash. A shadow of its' former self, the Imperial Powers is now little more than a mutual defense alliance between the British Commonwealths and their aligned states."

  FACTION_LEAGUE_OF_NATIONS:0 "§YMember of the§! §CLeague of Nations§!"
  FACTION_LEAGUE_OF_NATIONS_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §CLeague of Nations§!, an international military alliance dedicated to restoring democracy in Europe. Headquartered in London, the League is primarily lead by the British and German Empires, supported by their secondary allies in the Second Great War.\n\nThe League of Nations is administrated by the Central Council, made up of the major powers opposing the Revanchist Pacte, with the General Committee being made up of representatives of League member states. Central Council members maintain veto power over resolutions, which can be overturned by a majority General Committee vote. Among other things, the League intends to function as an international unifying force to promote European and democratic values across the world, as well as improving conditions in its' member states. Criticism has been leveled at the organization, however, as some nations feel that the Eurocentric nature of the group may lead to it being used as an extension of Anglo-German Imperialism."

  FACTION_REVANCHIST_PACTE:0 "§YMember of the Pacte Revanchiste§!"
  FACTION_REVANCHIST_PACTE_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YPacte Revanchiste§!, a provisional military alliance established by the French Republic in 1929. Though initially only consisting of France, the alliance is part of a greater ambition of the French state to expand their military reach across Europe. With France's diplomatic isolationism waning, it seems likely many nations might look to their Pact of Revenge for guidance."

  FACTION_PAN_ASIAN_FRONT:0 "§YMember of the Pan-Asian National Revolutionary Front§!"
  FACTION_PAN_ASIAN_FRONT_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YPan-Asian National Revolutionary Front§!, or Han'ajia kokka kakumei sensen, a military alliance established by the Republic of Japan in the late 1920s. Espousing a doctrine of Asian self-determination and rebellion, the Pan-Asian Front is the conduit by which Japan expands their influence across Asia. The idea of \"Asia for Asians\" has become very alluring to many, as the region remains largely dominated by the British, German and Dutch colonial dictates. Depending on the leadership of the Japanese state, this alliance may act as a legitimate force for unity, but in the wrong hands could easily be used to enforce the dominance of Japan's revolutionary government."

  FACTION_GLOBAL_REVOLUTIONARY_FRONT:0 "§YMember of the Global Revolutionary Front§!"
  FACTION_GLOBAL_REVOLUTIONARY_FRONT_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YGlobal Revolutionary Front§!, a military alliance between the [JAP.GetName] and the [SCA.GetName]. Originally just an alliance consisting of Japan and her Jacobin allies the Pan-Asian National Revolutionary Front has now become known as the Global Revolutionary Front, an global spanning faction dedicated to spreading the revolutionary cause through war, subversion, and espionage."

  FACTION_CMEA:0 "§YMember of the C.M.E.A§!"
  FACTION_CMEA_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YCouncil of Mutual Economc Assistance§!, an economic alliance created by America in the hopes of improving the standard of living for all jacobins across the world. The C.M.E.A is responsible for external trade between America, diplomatic affairs, and some military operations."

  FACTION_UNITED_EMIRATES:0 "§YMember of the United Arab Emirates§!"
  FACTION_UNITED_EMIRATES_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YUnited Arab Emirates§!, or al-'Imārāt al-'Arabīyyah al-Muttahidah, a union of Arab states formed following their emacipation from the Ottoman Empire in 1925. Rather than being a conventional military alliance, the United Emirates functions more like a Confederation of nations akin to the former Holy Roman Empire. Emirs are de-facto vassals of the Emir of Mecca and Hejaz, but in practice they are given significant autonomy due to tribal and dynastic rivalries. While this system has bought stability, it has also precipitated conflict between the Arab tribal dynasties over the perpetual re-elections of the Hashemites."

  FACTION_NORTHERN_COMMITTEE:0 "§YMember of the Northern Defense Committee§!"
  FACTION_NORTHERN_COMMITTEE_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YNorthern Defense Committee§!, a military alliance formed between the Kingdom of Sweden and the newly independent Finland in 1924. Essentially just a pact to deter Russian adventurism in Finland, the Northern Defense Committee has limited ties with Norway and Denmark, though the two are not officially protected by it. With Sweden's historic neutrality broken by their support of the Finns, the NDC is likely just the beginning of Sweden's opening to the larger world."

  FACTION_HAMBURG_LEAGUE:0 "§YMember of the Hamburg League§!"
  FACTION_HAMBURG_LEAGUE_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YHamburg League§!, a military alliance formed between by the United Kingdoms of Germany with the goal of protecting stability and democracy in Europe. Essentially a front to counter French Expansionism and Russian adventurism, where minor nations can receive protection and support from Frankfurt. The alliance is closely in contact with Great Britian and is maybe the first step to European Unity."

  FACTION_CIS:0 "§YMember of the Coalition Of Independent States§!"
  FACTION_CIS_LONG:0 "This nation is a member of the §YCoalition Of Independent States§!, a military alliance formed by America with the goal of protecting stability and democracy across the globe, although it specifically in recent times has targeted the commonwealths and dominions of the British Empire . Essentially a front to counter British Expansionism, where minor nations can receive protection and support from Philadelphia."
