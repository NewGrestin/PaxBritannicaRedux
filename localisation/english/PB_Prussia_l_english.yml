The history of Russian occupation is one filled with few facts or notable events, seemingly the only thought on every Prussians’ mind was survival against the struggles of everyday life.\n\nThe old conservative leadership of Prussia had allied itself with the Bourbons prior to the outbreak of the First Great War, a decision that would cost the nation it’s very independence with the signing of the Treaty of Tours. It wouldn’t be until Russia’s failure to calm its many non-Russian ethnic groups that Prussia would see itself shortly proclaim its renewed independence under a liberal constitutional-monarchy, this government however was short lived. Bouhler, a mere cavalry officer, would march on Königsberg alongside thousands of disfranchised Prussian veterans of the Great War, leading to the establishment of the Vaterlandsfront and the death of democracy in the nation.\n\nFew know the course Prussia will take in the following months, rumours can be heard that the old aristocratic elements of the Prussian military and government are plotting to overthrow Bouhler and his twisted regime, only time can tell though.\n\nThe §YIndependent State of Prussia§! is an §HEmerging Power§!\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"

  POLITICS_Philipp_Bouhler_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!03/06/1896\n\n§YPhilipp Bouhler§! nicknamed the counsellor (§ODer Berater§!) has seen Prussia rise from the ashes as a rebirthed nation under Russian influence. A once simple farm boy turned solider during the great war he has seen the world at its quietest and loudest moments, serving in the Russian 3rd cavalry regiment. A regiment compromised of a Prussian majority that would soon turn against their forefathers in the Prussian war for independence during 1921. A war that proved successful in establishing a independent Prussia of sorts, heavily monitored by the Tsar's right hand.\n\nOriginally a fierce supporter of the democratic republic he soon saw through their antics and gained power through a bloody battle in Königsberg that lasted no longer than two days. Russia, meanwhile, looked with great interest towards Bouhler seeing him as a leader who aligned more towards their views and a possible proponent for a more Russian dominated Prussia. Secretly funding him and his Vaterland Front."

Effectively the International is a §gtightly monitored global council§! known only by a few minds across the globe.

The second goal of the International is an even greater well-kept secret than the organisation itself and has yet to be revealed to the remainder of the council by Bouhler. The Universal Empire is an imagined, empire, that will in the words of Bouhler “§gUnite the disparate tribes of the globe under one single universal banner, with one single purpose, under a single people.§!” This fact is to remain indefinitely secret until Bouhler decides the time is right, should the reality of the International be somehow compromised then this very organisation will likely cease to function.\n\nIf we are to achieve the ambitions of the International then we must spread the influence of the council across the globe, invest in certain continents through the respective decisions below and should the presence of the council reach a certain threshold new opportunities may prevent themselves.\n\n\n                                              \n\n\n\n\nClick on each individual council member to access decisions based on the continent under their jurisdiction.\n"

Due to this, there is a vocal portion of the population advocating for Prussia's return to the Russian Empire. These Russophile elements of Prussian society, if empowered, would likely see Prussia fully return to Russia's embrace.

Both of these groups are disproportionately affected by poverty and while the Prussonationalists have attempted to remain pluralistic, there are elements of the nationalist factions that wish to see these minorities Germanized or outright removed. Inversely, the Polish and Lithuanian minorities bleeding in over the porous border often have nationalist or left wing sentiments, leading to the Prussian borderlands becoming a thriving ecosystem of anti-Russian underground groups. This situation must be solved or at least brought under control or it may have dangerous consequences for the Prussian government."

  Prussian.21.t:0 "Tea Time With Russia"
  Prussian.21.d:0 "Europe had transformed into a web of complex alliances and power struggles. Heinrich von Stein, a man of keen intellect and a deep understanding of geopolitical dynamics, found himself at the centre of it all. As he strolled through the opulent halls of the Prussian royal palace, his mind raced with thoughts about the delicate balance of power that held the continent together. At any moment in time the order of Europe could be upended and Prussia would be left to the wayside on its own, or worse, under the thumb of the Russian Tsar, again. That day, an urgent message had arrived from Russia requesting an audience with von Stein. It was no secret that Russia had risen to hegemonic power, dominating her respective sphere of influence and had recently sort to align the Independent State of Prussia closer to St. Petersburg’s interests.\n\nIn his lavishly adorned office, von Stein welcomed the Russian ambassadors. With a stoic demeanour and piercing eyes that seemed to reveal his understanding of their intentions, he offered them seats and poured some tea. The atmosphere was cordial, but the undercurrent of tension was palpable.\n\n”Let my intentions be clear gentlemen, Bouhler has made it most apparent that Prussia has not the slightest appetite to ally itself with your respective empire.”\n\n”You think we came here in search of an alliance?” Questioned the Russian ambassador, with a nod of approval from his colleague. “Why else would you have requested audience with me? We are well aware of your countries efforts to extend the military access Bouhler had once granted your regime.”\n\n”I take it you haven’t any interest in renewing such a fruitful clause?”\n\n”Not the slightest, in fact I have a note from Der Berater himself.” Responded Stein.\n\nHe navigated his hand over an unstable pile of documents and notes that littered his desk and with an unnatural precision of the eye picked out a single envelope.\n\n”All the details are within this letter, I shall request that you take a moment outside to read it and once you are done just knock on my door and we shall discuss the matter in earnest.” "
