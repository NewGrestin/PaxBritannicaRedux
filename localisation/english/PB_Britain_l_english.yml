  ENG_HM_Edward_VIII_EXILE_DESC:0 "His royal majesty, situated in a prestigious villa within his African realm, patiently awaits the day when he and his cabinet can return to mainlaind Britain as liberators of the Anglo-Saxon world. However the reality of the situation is bleak at best, much like that of the late Byzantine Empire Edward finds himself leading a nation of broken dreams. The British Empire might live on but there is no doubt that it is a former shell of itself, and any inspiration to reclaim its glory can only be spurred up in the books of science-fiction. The Pax Britannica is dead and the world now watches the French and Russian hegemons with sceptical eyes, but Britain promises that one day, no matter the cost, it will return home.\n\n§RThe French and Russian filth will measure their succeses in barrels of blood, and we the Anglo people will have our vengeance.§!"

Yet, while the continent of civilisation itself is back to civilisation again, the foreign lands beyond still beckon. Asia, a continent of pseudo-civilised men, remains the headache of the empire, as a pan-Asianist Japan, a former ally against French revanchism, has itself turned against the British status quo.

Designed to do the dirty work while saving lives and resources, the ISS is the prime tool needed in our hands to bash upcoming threats with.

The ideas of self-governance and liberty propagated by the Japanese has penetrated the political and academic native elites of our colonies, leading to resistance against our imperialism. While local troops are currently keeping the order, we cannot let the situation just continue. As our grasp on Asia slowly falters, so may our grasp on the world.

Devastated by war and with refugees in the streets, economic incentives are needed to prop up our little bit of Britain in Russia. A plan has been on the table for a long time, proposed by Jewish American-born economist George Marshal, depicting a five year long plan to kick start modernisation in the wake of devastation in the British-occupied urban pockets of Russia. This "Marshal Plan" can help the Russian people and buy their hearts and minds as long as the civil war roars through their fractured country."

The traditional family structure is crumbling as men are not able to properly maintain their families any longer. Meanwhile, women seek to provide for their families with the few jobs that remain in Britain, manning bars and scrubbing floors. Automatics have even infiltrated culture, as more and more music is reliant on mechanical thingamabobs and theatre gets replaced with telescreens.

With so many people unemployed, unable to give the nation what it needs through their muscle, we are given the opportunity to reform our economy into a theoretical \"service economy\", where our main produce is our service involving other people.

A special ministry, separate from the ministry of economics and trade, has been established by parliament with the goal of reducing the unemployment percentage through assigning the unemployed with temporary payed jobs, like cleaning the streets and ticket inspectors.

Where the arguments of hard labour and long hours once worked wonders to convince the public, those jobs have recently become filled with automatic instead of human labourers. The service economy is, compared to the previous economic system, far more tender and elegant, allowing suffragettes to argue that the government should involve more women in the economy.

Across every street in Britain, posters of smiling families and Edison-patented robotics are plastered. On the radio waves, jingle after jingle remind listeners of the great bounty that EIEC brought to Britain, compared to the rest of the world. EIEC has even gone so far to install an enormous telescreen on Piccadilly square, turning heads across London to the fantastical imagery of robots working in the fields and mines, accompanied by a posh, though friendly voice informing the people of the wonders of innovation."

However, the ability to project imagery to any particular telescreen device is a technology with serious military and security potential, turning it into a serious threat in the wrong hands.

In the future, the telescreen industry is sure to be profitable, innovative and important in citizen's day to day life. Such an increase in the average wealth of British citizens cannot be ignored by the government and special financial grants are thus in place.

Already, Commonwealth governments have petitioned the British government to relax its export laws surrounding its high-tech sector and promote the distribution of these next gen automatons to the colonies. They argue that augmenting their economies with similar automatic labour may prove crucial to the imperial economy and commonwealth relations in the coming decades, for these territories do not wish to remain the impoverished economic periphery."

  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_Goal_desc:0 "With talks of reform and readjustments to the British African Authority over the coming months, it is therefore paramount to summon the local tribal rulers and other chieftains to discuss what we shall do with our colony. The British African Authority is made up of the balance of power of local treaties and alliances with British rule and any reform which may tread on the toes of these rulers may cause the colony to burn- an outcome which no one desires least all London. So by inviting these local liaisons we shall ensure that the balance of power is maintained and the transition of the colony smoothly enforced."

  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_Ignore_Locals_desc:0 "Evelyn Baring is a man with powerful influence in the British African Authority. The de facto protector of the international settlement colonies and the main advocate for a more conservative reform of the British African Authority. Baring has put forward a proposal in his 'Baring Papers' to carve out new colonial states from the African Authority.\n\nThis however puts forward the plan to ignore local settlers and rulers in favour for more Anglo overlords in West Africa which could lead to potential rebellion from the natives however if accepted the African Authority would split into more stable settler colonies and mining mandates for London- a most favourable proposal."
  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_African_Autonomy:0 "Accept the Big Six Proposal"
  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_African_Autonomy_desc:0 "The Big Six Proposal is the idea of splitting the British African Authority into six states which will please all factions involved. This would see the settler colonies around the lakes become new Dominions in the Empire alongside the international mandate gaining more autonomy. The catch to this however is that instead of creating a new colony from whatever is left from the settler states which would be ruled over by commissioners from London; it is argued that a native ruled Commonwealth is to be formed from the remaining territories to give way to a new enlightened Imperialism.\n\nThis would please many reformists in the Imperial Federation alongside the native Africans who would be guided to create a new society of their own. The snag is that by gifting the Africans their own state and autonomy- it could lead to colonial decline in West Africa and possible independence wars in the Dark Continent; a most unfavourable outcome to London."

  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_North_Africa_Reform_desc:0 "The local colonial civil servants and Administrators in the former French and Italian colonies mostly are Frenchmen and Italians. With war looming over Europe with these nations alongside more Anglo settlers in the former Latin colonies, the time has come to replace these possible treasonous civil servants with Anglo civil servants. This will see a more streamlined administrative service in British Africa and more importantly a more loyal civil service to run things in the continent."

  PB_ENG_Africa_BAF_North_Africa_Maintain_desc:0 "The Algiers-Tripoli Accord is a proposed treaty that would see the British Maghreb Territory to be split in two. Algeria would remain under British rule whilst Libya would be granted to Emir Idris who would swear fealty to the British crown. This would allow us to consolidate our forces in the more precious colony of Algeria instead of spreading colonial forces thin across North Africa.\n\nThe side affect to this would see a powerful Emirate take over Libya who although will be grateful for our benevolence of granting them such a boon, could turn on at the first opportunity they receive which would make the British government look quite the fool."

  PB_ENG_Africa_End_BAF_desc:0 "After much debate over a period of months, the time has come for the British African Authority to be dissolved into a multitude of new colonial states and protectorates.

  PB_ENG_britannia_waves_desc:0 " The shattered water made a misty din. Great waves looked over others coming in, and thought of doing something to the shore that water never did to land before. The clouds were low and hairy in the skies, like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes. You could not tell, and yet it looked as if the shore was lucky in being backed by cliff, the cliff in being backed by continent; It looked as if a night of dark intent was coming, and not only a night, an age. Someone had better be prepared for rage. There would be more than ocean-water broken before Gods last Put out the light was spoken. -Robert Frost."

  PB_ENG_britannia_world_desc:0 "He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled, that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust, but still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust. If we who sight along it round the world, see nothing worthy to have been its mark, it is because like men we look too near, forgetting that as fitted to the sphere, our missiles always make too short an arc. They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect The curve of earth, and striking, break their own; They make us cringe for metal-point on stone. But this we know, the obstacle that checked and tripped the body, shot the spirit on further than target ever showed or shone. -Robert Frost."

There is no real army of the British Central Authority. Most of the units are still old colonial divisions from Nigeria, Guinea or Ghana. But no new formations have been created from the newly accuired territories populations due to distrust of arming their new colonial subjects. The Government of Alexandria sees no need for centralizing the army command and increase conscription, the focus of the colony lies on increasing their benefits not to waste large sums in an unneded colonial striking force.

Several regions remain unexplored, others treasure undiscovered resources and there are so many people to interact with.

The vast amount of different people also create more severe problems. The people of the many lands are of different faiths and ethnicity complicating centralization efforts. Especially hard is the cooperation with the natives of the newly acquired colonies from France.

Land is violently taken away from the natives for the settlers and any kind of resistance faces more violence. However what worked so easy in the good old times of the UC does not seem to bear the same fruits here in Africa. The ethnic groups, especially the Mahdist, Dervishes and Mau Mau continue to arm themself and fight back harder, focusing their attacks on settlers themself.\n\nPershing's Administration only knows one answer for these rising problems ... more violence. However Pershings recent methods involving fire bombinging jungles and realeasing Combatagates into the wild are facing more and more appaling reactions in London which could cost him his head."

  britain.1.d:0 "The Saharan sun bled over the horizon, casting the city in a deep amber hue. It scattered itself across the skyline, lighting up skyscrapers and worming its’ way down to the shanties beneath. It struck the briny Moroccan sea and bounced off, a few errant strands of light landing on the face of Prince George. His beard had grown unkempt, bloodshot eyes watching the zeppelins pass overhead. Nurses carried on about the room as the Queen watched from afar. She’d only visited Carnegia on diplomatic missions or ceremony, the appointment of another grandson to Governor-General or some such affairs. The last time she’d been here was for Edward’s death, and now she was here for her his son’s. Even with industrial grade fans, the room was stiflingly warm, not helped by the dozen people crammed into it.\n\nAlbert sat nearest to the bed, running his fingers down the bridge of his nose to his mouth. He stared off at seemingly nothing, his eyes resting on anything in the room but his dying brother. Edward paced the room, visibly exhausted from the multi-day flight from the American wilds. His eyes were sullen, a hint of bloodshot, he’d had one too many a “nightcap” on the flight. Victoria tried to keep her mind on other matters and scanned the streets below. It was market day, thousands of people flowing through the stalls of the city, the faint smell of tagine just barely perceptible through the hospital window.

The husk of a man in the bed was all that was left of him, holding hands with the husk of a grandmother a century past her time.

The coughing came on once more, doubling her frail body over as she tried to lean against a nearby wall, her mouth was flush with the taste of blood. The only thing that pulled her from the fit was one of the doctors approaching from behind.\n\n“Your majesty,” he said “the Governor is dead.”"

Caught off guard, the small Danish garrisons, already demoralized by news of Copenhagens defeat, were quickly disarmed. Though clearly not pleased with the turn of events, there was little that the Danes could do to prevent the occupation.

All this talk of independence has begun to make the occupation authorities uneasy. The last thing we need is insurrection on an island as inhospitable as Iceland.\n\nFrom this unease has come a handful of proposals to London on how best to resolve the Icelandic dissent. The most obvious solution is to simply end the occupation, granting Iceland independence in exchange for remaining in the Imperial Powers until the war is finished. A more radical solution, popular among British warhawks, is to pressure the Althing into accepting a constitutional monarchy and commonwealth status under the British Empire. Such a move would be an outrage to the Danes, but as it stands right now they aren't in much of a position to do more than protest. Simply remaining on the island and continuing the occupation would be deeply unpopular with both the Icelandic people and our own, as well as a drain on our resources, but it would ensure we have the most control over Reykjavíks ports."

Without a hint of hesitation, Margesson submitted a vote against Edens leadership of the Conservative party, and in the course of half an hour Eden had lost everything. By the time the vote concluded, Margesson ruled the Tories alone, and Eden had but a single thing to say before he vanished out the door and into the footnotes of history."

  britain.84.d:0 "Taking power as the first NPP Prime Minister in history would be one thing, but Orman wouldn't have settled for just one history making move. She was now the first woman to take up the office of the Prime Minister. The irony of a patriot doing this over a progressive was not lost on her, or her cabinet, as it drafted plans to begin undermining the nascent Union party.\n\nWhile most spoke merely of denouncements and defamations, there was an unspoken plan amongst them that was of a far more violent variety. The Blackshirts, paramilitaries of the party, were free actors and could be thrown under the bus whenever necessary. All they needed was a little push to go from mere supporters to fanatic patriots."
  britain.84.a:0 "History will what we do here to be necessary"

  britain.85.t:0 "The Million Man March"
  britain.85.d:0 "Across Britain, hundreds of thousands of blackshirts flooded the streets in one of the largest political demonstrations in recent history. Police, shackled by engagement rules issued under the Orman government, were forced to sit idly by as the blackshirts marched. A strictly peaceful march, of course, but many understood the implication of interference.\n\nOrman herself issued little statement beyond her appreciation for the blackshirt support. When asked about how the blackshirts had acquired military grade equipment, she merely stated that perhaps they were assisted by free actors, and that she would make a formal inquest into the issue."

  britain.86.t:0 "Orman addresses the Nation"
  britain.86.d:0 "In a rousing speech before parliament, Prime Minister Orman produced evidence that the Workers Union Party has been planning a Jacobin coup against the government. The mere suggestion of such was thought inconceivable, but the Prime Minister offered detailed plans stolen from party member Harry Pollitt that indicated the hardliners planned to oust the moderates and abolish the monarchy.\n\nThe speech sent parliament into uproar, with the Workers Union MPs attempting to issue a no confidence vote. Instead, however, they found themselves completely outvoted by Conservatives and NPP, now united in fury. The Union Party members stormed out of the House of Commons, surrendering the room to the now triumphant reactionary front."
  britain.86.a:0 "We're doing what needs to be done...I hope."

  britain.87.t:0 "There will be Blood"
  britain.87.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Orman proclamation, the nation has been plunged into chaos. Street fights have broken out between WUP party members and NPP blackshirts. In the midst of the chaos, multiple major members of the Workers Union Party have been harassed, assaulted or even assassinated.\n\nAmong these, however, has been Clement Attlee. While returning home, Attlee was accosted by a group of armed thugs and gunned down in the streets of the London Sprawl. Attlees death has caused a breakdown in the party, with Pollitt in custody for treason and Mosley nowhere to be found. The Workers Union Party finds itself in crisis, and Ormans plan has succeeded, although not quite as she might have intended."

  britain.88.t:0 "Support from the Right"
  britain.88.d:0 "In the wake of the near dissolution of the Workers Union Party, the Tories and Whigs have offered their support to Ormans government. Orman herself has taken the opportunity to propose the National Security Act, which would help to stabilize the nation in this time of crisis.\n\nThere has been critcism of the act for potentially giving the Prime Minister too many vague powers, along with a vaguely defined crisis. Orman has shot down these criticisms, claiming that the prime minister must do everything in her power to stabilize the nation."
  britain.88.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
  
  britain.89.t:0 "A Triumph of the Will"
  britain.89.d:0 "As the last votes were tallied, it was becoming increasingly clear that Ormans gamble had finally paid off. It had been a long road to this moment, through the early years of the movement to the shock of the electoral victory. The NPP had always been envisioned as counter-revolutionary, yet by circumstance it would prove the opposite. The first woman in the office of Prime Minister, a veteran of the Great War in her own right, and now the person who would plant the Union Jack in the black heart of British socialism.\n\nCheers broke out amongs the MPs, Margesson nodding quietly as the Prime Ministers motion was confirmed. Eden sat quietly off to the side, his eyes seemed duller, almost hollow. Mosley and Pollitt hadn't even attended the vote, the former too busy fighting off yet another Union leadership vote and the latter having seemingly vanished from the public eye. Orman herself stood triumphant, taking in the cheers and jeers of parliament.\n\nWith this motion, she now wielded a new set of emergency powers, powers that would grant her the authority to finally put down the socialists for good and permanently cement English patriotism as the law of the land. Of course, some concessions needed to be made, and if the Imperial League needed to be thrown under the trolley then so be it. She could practically see the blood on her hands, but she didn't care. Britains path to the future was bright, she would see to that."

  britain.90.t:0 "Fuller and Harris"
  britain.90.d:0 "The new military guided regime has come to be dominated by two main figures, JFC Fuller and Arthur Harris. Fuller sees most of his support from the former NPP and ultranationalist groups, and is at best a vicious anti-semite. His leadership of the National Reorganization Front is more in spite of himself than because of it, and most of the current junta dislike him.\n\nThe main tapped to potentially replace Fuller is Arthur Harris, a British Aeronaut Marshal and more moderate military leader. Harris is inoffensive and seen as the most reputable public figure to head up the new administration going forwards. Fuller wishes to establish the military as a prime force in British politics, while Harris argues for the military to take a backseat and only intervene to ensure democracy is maintained."
  britain.90.a:0 "We need to resolve these disputes"

  britain.91.t:0 "Out with the Old..."
  britain.91.d:0 "The National Reorganization Front has brought on many firsts for Britain, including the formalization of an official constitution. The so-called Fuller-Harris Constitution enshrines the role of the military in protecting British democracy whenever necessary. It also grants vague, sweeping powers to the ruling military council to determine the legality and constitutionality of political parties, functionally allowing the junta to ban or allow parties in elections on a whim."

  britain.93.d:0 "All Victoria needed to do was sign the paper, and she could leave. Signing off on this paper, however, would rob her of everything. The coup, whatever it was intended to originally solve, was a power grab. She was comfortable admitting that now. This, however, this sheet of paper would take away all of it.\n\nIt was a simple demand submitted by the generals. She would hand over her remaining temporal powers as monarch to the junta, and she would receive nothing in exchange. Not even a pat on the back for strangling her countrys democracy. She sighed, and with a penstroke, Victoria went from the absolute Queen of the British Empire to a sad, scrawny woman in a fancy uniform, left to stew on her mistakes in a gilded cage."
  britain.93.a:0 "Some mistakes can't be undone."

  britain.94.t:0 "A New Britain"
  britain.94.d:0 "The British public greeted the end of the National Reorganization Front with cheers, though most that might jeer were too concerned to do so. In a series of speeches, Victoria and her military backers announced that British democracy had been saved from the clutches of the anarchists. The new Salvation Party would be the future of Democracy, where all would have a say in their nation without fear of socialist repression.\n\nThough some were at least uncaring about the circumstance, many more embraced this new political reality. The Salvation Party offered a number of options, each delicately hand selected by generals and officers. All that the public knew was that democracy was back, all the while their own generals had drug it back behind the alley and strangled it in the name of protecting it."
  britain.94.a:0 "The path to hell is paved with good intentions."

  britain.95.t:0 "Doing Away with the Social Rot"
  britain.95.d:0 "Returning to office, Prime Minister Orman has continued her plans for the NPPs doctrine in 1937. With the Mental Hygiene Act and the National Security Act, she has seen the chance to begin pushing the party ideology even further. While the Workers Union Party remains irrelevant, there are many more social diseases that can be dealt with.\n\nActing under the purview of the Mental Hygiene Act, Prime Minister Orman set out a series of new guidelines effectively making socialist thought a mental illness. Under this designation, hundreds of major socialist figures across the nation are marked for arrest, internment and compulsory sterilization. Further expansions of the laws have placed legal restrictions on homosexuality, as well as expanding restrictions on Miscegenation."
  britain.95.a:0 "Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me!"

  britain.96.t:0 "Waiting for Worms"
  britain.96.d:0 "As bombs fall across Europe, Prime Minister Orman led a lengthy speech to the House of Commons. The National Security Act, passed in 1933, is to be invoked as a wartime emergency provision. With few in parliament willing to oppose the action, and some in the Conservatives even opting to join the new emergency government, the Act was put in place with little meaningful resistance.\n\nArmed with sweeping emergency powers, Orman has begun a mass crackdown across Britain against so-called Francophiles. Anyone opposing the new government has been branded as such, and already the militarized Blackshirt brigades have begun running clean and sweep operations across Britain. The nation, wracked by the uncertainty of war, will be stable and it will be peaceful. The Isles will be safe in the warm grip of a state of total war, guided by the vision of a single dictatress.\n\nBritish democracy lies dead, and what lies ahead is a state unrecognizable from the one which entered the war."

Having seceded during the Secession Crisis, Ulster is a point of contention between our two governments. Ireland has put forward a list of demands, primarily the protection of Irish Catholics in the region from retaliatory attacks.\n\nThe situation in Northern Ireland remains less than ideal at the moment, as while the Ulster Volunteer Forces have sworn allegiance to the Crown, they are not officially backed by the British government. Still, openly abandoning loyal British citizens in the wake of this humiliation would be deeply unpopular with the public, many of whom are still reeling from the defeat in the first place. We have some options, however, as there is a counter proposal on the table to convert Northern Ireland into a neutral buffer between our two governments. Switzerlandization of Northern Ireland is not quite the most patriotic option, but it is a viable way to prevent further conflict.\n\nOn the inverse, backing up Ulster in full may reignite hostilities with Ireland. Though definitely the least diplomatic option, it could prove a valuable opportunity to knock the upstart Irish republic down a notch lest they get any big ideas."

  britain.1011.d:0 "Gallachers election to the Prime Ministership has caused a not inconsiderable rift within the Workers Union Party between the radicals and the reformists. The decidedly anarchist direction which Gallachers cabinet has taken the party has caused the reformist faction, headed by Mosley and Attlee, to become disillusioned with the WUP. They continually fight against the most important reforms of Gallachers platform, and party infighting makes it difficult to use our parliamentary support to our advantage.\n\nIn light of this, Gallacher has assembled a coalition of the radical party heads from throughout the WUP and proposed an alliance with the United Republican Front. A fringe Jacobin faction, the URF has remained a vocal but largely powerless left wing faction in Britain for some time. Gallacher believes that aligning with the URF and rallying his supporters in the United Trade Unions will give him the political support to oust Mosley and Attlee from their positions of authority in the WUP. The move would be extremely risky, as the reformists make up a not inconsiderable portion of the party leadership.

This has been a catastrophe for our parliamentary support, but thankfully the support of the UTU and the radicals has become even stronger.

  britain.1043.d:0 "In a shocking announcement to parliament, Prime Minister Mosley submitted a proposal for the abolition of the British monarchy and the declaration of a Republic. The proposal, clearly penned by new party head Harry Pollitt, was met with near instantaneous backlash. Before Mosley could even finish speaking, parliament had erupted into chaos. WUP ministers exchanged blows with their fellows before Mosley, seemingly egged on by Pollitt, ordered for local troops to intervene. A small contingent of British Home Guard, loyal to the party, mobilized on the House of Commons and seized it after a short shootout.\n\nGiven the chance to finish, his words now backed by gun barrels, Mosley nervously announced that parliament would be disbanded and replaced by a new British Workmen Council. The Council would be the foundation of the new United British Republic of the Common Man, severing all ties to the monarchy and handing power to the people. Mosleys words, broadcast by telescreen across the nation, invoked panic instead of praise. Citizens began frantically organizing into militias for either side, with a few reported fatalities when said opposing groups met. Riots broke out at ration centers as the population tried to hoard as much as they could for the coming crisis.\n\nInstead of a civil war, however, Mosley and Pollitts coup would end in a whimper.\n\nOnce made aware of the situation, British High Command mobilized and assaulted the House of Commons, quickly killing or arresting the Home Guard. In less than eight hours, the British Republic that the WUP proclaimed ended as Imperial hardsuits broke into parliament. Mosley, abandoned by Pollitt and his hardliner clique, was apprehended not long after, having reportedly soiled himself during the fighting.\n\nHigh Command has assumed provisonal control over Parliament for the time being, opting to suspend it until the Crisis is fully resolved. General JFC Fuller has been appointed the head of the provisional administration, vowing that democracy will be reinstated once every inch of the Union rot has been sponged, purged and if need be, blasted from British soil."

The report, delivered by agents of the Imperial Security Service, contained a series of reports by Jordanian and Palestinian travelers that a white man traveling alone in the Jordanian desert has been spotted on multiple occasions. It went on to indicate a high probability that the man being referred to may be the missing British Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence, though it cannot confirm this with absolute certainty.\n\nLawrence vanished from his posting in the Trucial States following the end of hostilities in the Great War. The reason for his disappearence is unknown, but colleagues attested to the ISS that his service during the North African campaign and the Arab Peacekeeping operations may have pushed him over the edge. Lawrences fascination with the Middle East is well known, and ISS agents have been combing the Arab Kingdoms for almost two decades in an effort to locate him. If this lead is to be believed, Lawrence may have been hiding beneath our noses this entire time. Our ISS office in Jerusalem has advised that we dispatch an agent to Jordan to locate this unidentified man post haste, as we may lose our chance to find him with the brewing chaos in the Near East."

Before the agents could investigate further, the cocking of a pistol drew the agents' attention to their flank.\n\nThere, masked in the amber glow of the setting desert sun, stood T.E Lawrence, though at first he was hardly recognizable. Dirty, unshaven and draped in Arab garb, he hardly looked anything like the file photo the agents had been given.\n\n\"I figured you people would come looking for me eventually.\"\n\n\"We're with Imperial Intelligence, we've been asked to bring you in for reassign-\"\n\n\"I'm not going back.

Ozymandias demanded his service once more, to protect his empire one last time before it slipped from his fingers and into the dustbin of history. It didn't matter if it was King Edward or Queen Victoria, the Emperors were all the same.\n\nStill, in a way he figured he owed his homeland some courtesy for not putting him down like a rabid dog. Sometimes, a hound gone wild still has use left in him for his master. One last ride, he figured, one last ride for the Empire.\n\nOne last ride and he could finally be free, spilling blood just this one time more in exchange for freedom.\n\nThey left the next morning for the border of the mandate, and though Lawrence couldn't shake his pessimism, he did have to admit it would be nice to have a proper bed again."

The French garrison had refused to surrender, and his body shook when he recalled how their commanders had simply shrugged and given the order to open fire. Tens of thousands of tonnes of steel hellfire raining down on a city of nearly a million, and he just sat back and watched, and he swore he would never raise a rifle for the Empire again.\n\nThe agents left silently, riding off home to their masters. Lawrence continued on as though they had never came, pouring over endless tomes of obscure Arabian history. Perhaps, he figured, one day he might make the trip to Mecca once this terrible succession war business blows over.\n\nThe contents of the Lawrence report submitted to the IIS were unremarkable, and few questioned the statements on some Great War fossil lost in his own madness in a savage desert. The report was filed away among the millions of reports in the IIS archives, disappearing into an ocean of bureaucracy, and with it went the last memories of Colonel Lawrence."

As blood pooled around him, his fading vision caught one last glimpse of the setting desert sun, the light reflecting off his own blood as it mixed with the sweeping sand.\n\nColonel Lawrence bled to death an hour later, hogtied on the back of a camel headed back to Palestine. Though the agents tasked with acquiring him received a chewing out, most in the IIS concluded the man was a loose cannon. It wasn't their job to rescue some Great War veteran from his own madness, after all.\n\nColonel Lawrence found his resting place a little over a month later in a Veterans cemetary in Wales. Though the grave was periodically the host to small gatherings by veterans of the Algiers Campaign, over time the meetings would fade away, along with whatver memory of Colonel Lawrence that might have remained."

Roosevelt, on leave in the isles due to being wounded on the Western front, briefly met the princess at a charity event and the two began correspondance. Roosevelts status as a war hero in the Netherlands and his family standing among the Dutch aristocracy paved the way for celebrity across the Empire. Both continued their efforts for Veterans charities while corresponding, ultimately leading to their engagement.\n\nThe marriage of the two marks the most official formation of ties between the Netherlands and Britain, with Dutch and British hardline loyalists lauding the affair as an example of the Anglo-European imperial identity. The Queen-Empress has remained largely quiet on the affairs of his sister, and the rest of the Royal Family has given the courtship a bregruding approval."

But to first achieve such a far off dream the state must be further united and indivisible if it plans on conquering the entirety of India. Plans have been drafted to reform the dominion into a federation but individuals critical of such an idea have instead put forward a counter proposal, one that would see the administration instead become a unitary state."

Such a prestigious proclamation comes with its benefits but also expectations, and for Churchill’s case we are expecting quite a lot. "

As uneventful as his day was he had seen an odd increase in British naval vessels just off the coast. Joseph didn't take much note of it and simply continued tending to his sheep.\n\nAt approx 13:00 P.M. the ground near Joseph violently shook and amidst the assumed earthquake Joseph worryingly shouted for his wife Martha. Then in a blink of an eye the sky turned red, and a pure white flash engulfed Josephs vision. The seemingly holy encounter lasted only seconds, with white quickly turning to grey, and forming what seemed to be a mushroom far off in the distance, as large as the sun itself. Joseph and his now approaching wife both stopped and stared in horror.... both speechless of what their eyes were witnessing. For a while both had believed they had seen either the death of god or his return, both being equally true."

The Tribunal itself has been a relatively quick affair, with nearly every arrested official being sentenced to hang. In the East, the League of Nations Military Tribunal for Russia has been hard at work dealing with the remaining Russian loyalists. The former Russian royal family has, for the sake of stability, been offered conditional amnesty in the mandates until the end of the Civil War.

Tributes to Queen Victoria have poured in from around the world, with many leaders praising her long and dedicated service to her country.\n\nThe coronation of King Albert is expected to take place in the coming weeks, with preparations already underway.

  britain_victoria.1.d:0 "The facility was in shambles when they arrived, the gates torn down, the bunkers ablaze. The Americans had fled after Philadelphia fell; to where was the concern of Imperial Intelligence. Only the barest remnant of the base’s original purpose could be found outside. A shredded metal placard hung from the destroyed gate, bearing in bolded white letters:\n\n“TUSKEGEE GENETIC RESEARCH PROGRAM”\n\nThe private scowled, pushing his way past the fence flanked by a cadre of officers and agents. Whatever his squad found; it was important enough to send a razorgirl spook. He’d never seen one in the field, let alone before deployment. She withdrew a pocketbook from her coat, flipping through some notes before motioning to one of the nearby buildings.\n\n“That one,” she said, her voice had a slight metallic reverb. She glanced to the private.\n\n“Take your team and collect everything from that campus. Notes, reels, recordings, samples. Everything.”\n\nThe private gave a dejected “yes ma’am” and moved with the rest of his squad into the half-collapsed structure. Two went in the main entrance, while another two made their way around the back to link up in case any stragglers had tried to hole up inside.\n\nRubble crunching beneath their boots, the private and his gunner moved through the halls of the research campus, rifles in one hand and flashlamps in the other. The labs seemed to go on and on, a blur of glass encased rooms filled with endless racks of samples. Blood, sputum, sometimes even urine; it was a vast archive of thousands of people’s excretions. The private couldn’t make heads or tails of it until they linked up with the other team and broke down the barred metal doors of the main campus lab. The smell of death erupted from the opening, doubling half their number over in pools of vomit. Just more samples for whatever bizarre project the Americans were up to.\n\nGas masks firmly on and stomachs emptied, the men plumbed the depths of the lab to find out it wasn’t a lab at all. It was a morgue, a massive morgue, filled to capacity. One of his men bumped him on the shoulder, gesturing with his light at the labels on the morgue slabs. No names, just numbers, designations maybe?\n\nOne of the soldiers popped open a slab and predictably a body slid out. Curious, he popped open another, and the same dead man came out again. Ten minutes of opening morgue containers, ten minutes of finding the same corpse staring back. The private’s stomach turned over, uncertain looks from his squad cast in the glow of dim torchlight.\n\n“Close up the slabs, lock this room down and start grabbing paperwork.”"

  britain_victoria.2.d:0 "Victoria was laying on the surgery table, looking up blankly at the Victoria at her bedside. She wasn’t alive, not quite yet, but she still breathed and shifted unconsciously. The researcher stepped around the surgical bed and motioned to the Other Victoria, pushing his glasses up as he spoke nervously.\n\n“This is just a proof of concept, of course, but with the data we retrieved from the Americans we may have a workable version in a few months.”\n\nThe Queen sighed and ran her hand along the Other Queen’s. It was warm, like hers, but younger, softer. She was staring into a picture of herself in youth. A blank template to be slipped into when the mortal coil, and to some extent literal, coils within failed. A neutral expression slid into a frown as the Other Victoria was wheeled away.\n\n“If we do this,” she said, “will it still be me?”\n\n“The process should be seamless once the neurological transfer is complete.”\n\nShe thought of Albert, writhing in bed in the hours before he fell still. She thought of Edward, barely able to catch a breath as cancer tore through his body. She thought of George, bleary eyed in that Saharan sunset. How long could they wait? Could they wait for her? What if it didn’t work?\n\nQuestions swirled in her head before finally, she turned to the doctor and broke the silence."

  britain_victoria.3.d:0 "The first thing she felt was warmth, then pain. A slight prick on her arm shocked her awake, adrenaline flushing through the system like a breached dam. The body she awoke in was not her own. A crowd of doctors and technicians rushed to the Queen’s bedside, flipping through piles of ticker tape outputs and tapping at amber hued monitors. The first breath struck her lungs like fire, pupils dilated, teeth gritted, she felt bile lap at the back of her throat. The room was deafening to all but her, her ears still rang. The Queen wiped blood from her nose and with a voice that wasn’t quite hers, called out to the doctors.\n\n“Is it done?”\n\nHer voice was hoarse, she felt the scrapes of where the ventilator had struck. The nearest doctor nodded and began flipping through his notes. The doughy, middle-aged man pulled a small light from his lab coat and flashed it on and off in her eyes. The light made her neurons shriek. She pulled away from it, the bile threatened again to march on her throat.\n\n“Pupillary response is still good. You’ve been off the vent for at least a day now. We had to run a cooling cycle for the first few days, had to make sure you could still regulate your own temperature.”\n\n“How do I know I’m still me?”\n\nHe sighed and adjusted his glasses, motioning to another bed in the room. She was laying there, and she was laying here, and the her that laid there was still. The doctor grasped the other Victoria's arm, running his fingers over the veins.\n\n“Congratulations, your majesty,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re dead.”\n\nAn aide helped her to her feet. The body was meat, she moved clumsily, a driver in an unfamiliar model. She was laying in the bed, looking down at herself as the nurses cleaned her corpse. A staggered step forward and the Queen laid her hand on the cold palm of her counterpart. The Victoria in the bed was gaunt, eyes sunken in, innumerable ports across her arms and shoulders. She ran her hand across her own clavicle, expecting the sting of an infusion port but finding only skin and muscle. She glanced back at the doctor.\n\n“Which one of us is the real one?”\n\nHe shrugged, motioning to the other Victoria. The face of her own mortality sat still, the occasional synaptic twitch carrying the last signals from a brain that did not yet realize it was dead.\n\n“Does it matter?”"

  britain_victoria.4.d:0 "The artificial sky over London was bathed in the glow of dusk, light shimmering down between the support pillars to the ground below. Innumerable trains moved back and forth across the skyline, carrying innumerable people throughout the superstructure. Only the barest hints of sunlight broke though the steel canopy; on a good day, you might catch sight of the sun on the horizon if you stood in the right spot. Buckingham, however, was not in such a spot. The symbol of regality in Britain was entombed within the steel spires of the London Sprawl, consumed by the steel gullet of the Empire it commanded. Victoria watched traffic flow by on the street below, nursing her third glass of whiskey that morning. One of the many benefits of this new body; she could drink like a young woman again, for better and worse. Mostly worse.\n\nA door creaked open and one of the doctors slipped in, flipping through the pages of a clipboard. He didn’t bother noting the half empty bottle on the table; they’d long since given up trying to convince her otherwise.\n\n“How are you feeling, your majesty?”\n\nShe swirled her drink, watching the miniature whirlpool until it dissipated.\n\n“I started having dreams again.”\n\n“That’s good,” he said, scribbling a few notes. “It’s common to experience certain dissociative episodes during deep sleep; a by-product of the neurological transfer. Can you recall anything about these dreams?”\n\n“Just the one,” she set the glass down, swiveling in her chair to face the doctor. “I’m in a manor, I don’t think it was any one in particular, walking down a hallway towards an open door. There’s a party in the room, I think. People talking, moving around, that sort of thing. When I get to the door, it’s a parlor room, it’s night outside and everyone is standing or sitting facing me.”\n\nThe scribbling stopped, the doctor looking up from his notes.\n\n“Everyone?”\n\n“Albert, Edward, George, Alice, they were all there. They’d waited for so long, I don’t know how I knew that in the moment, but I did. Albert started walking towards me; he didn’t look sick anymore, he was smiling. Then, the door closed, and I was alone in that dark hallway."

  britain_victoria.5.d:0 "The ballroom thrummed with the sounds of jazz and clinking glasses. A crowd swayed back and forth on the dance floor, hypnotized by wailing of the trumpets. Aristocrats, new and old, boozed about with one another as the Queen watched from afar. The party was more of a formality than anything; the proper announcement would come the following morning. A few steps and she was flowing through the crowd, shaking hands and sharing bows. Businessmen, titans of industry, princes and princesses of this or that house; congratulations were shared all around. They were all young once again, young alongside their Queen, and would be young forevermore. She played a game of spotting the slight imperfections, trying to see who was still in their first body and who had already been decanted.\n\nA duke who by all accounts should have been in his eighties shook her hand vigorously; he looked like he couldn’t be older than thirty. A group of Edison shareholders polished off their second bottle in the corner; men and women who she could have sworn were in their twilight years a few months before. The fountain of youth had been cracked open and its’ bounty flowed freely into the waiting mouths of new and old money.\n\nVictoria reached the head of the crowd and raised a glass to an uneasy toast. She forced a smile as the crowd burst into rapturous applause, a sea of replicated smiles facing back at her.\n\nThen, the party resumed, and the throng of guests danced and drank and celebrated. Not a celebration for the Queen, no, but a victory celebration. The celebration of a conqueror over the conquered, glasses raised in triumph like so many bloody axes over a fallen foe. Death was the last enemy to be destroyed and destroyed he had been; the grim reaper’s bones thrown to the wind. And so they celebrated; aristocrats old and new, captains of industry, princes and princesses of the old world. They drank and danced in borrowed bodies for a night that would stretch into immutable eternity.\n\nAn immortal aristocracy blessed by their new industrial god of steel and blood to rule the fiefdom of humanity beyond death."

He finds himself reigning over a troubled nation, and an even more troubled empire. Noted for his open distaste for the rising popularity of the Workers Union party, many leftists now fear that Edward might abandon his political neutrality as King to interfere in politics. Amidst economic and political uncertainty, Edwards rise to power and lack of concern for constitutional processes has done little to ease the governments worries."
  ENG_King_George_Desc:0 "Born George Frederick Ernest Albert in 1865, His Royal Highness King George V, Emperor of India and the British Empire, is in many ways a man that lives within the shadow of his father. Succeeding Edward VII after his death in 1910, George inherited an empire utterly traumatized by the single most horrific conflict in human history. With Europe clutched tight in the grip of economic depression, only economic isolationism could prevent privation, and so George V oversaw the establishment of Britains diplomatic and economic isolationism from Europe. George V is most known for the catastrophic failure of the Indian Campaign, which saw the warhawk conservative goverment attempt to bolster their popularity with a quick campaign into India, hoping to finally rectify a black stain on British imperial history. George V openly endorsed the campaign and, when British forces were forced to halt due to heavy losses, his credability and the credability of the conservatives was badly damaged. This would ultimately force the conservatives into a coalition government with the Whig party in the subsequent elections. Now, in 1933, Georges health has begun to fail him. Frequently ill and delegating affairs to the rest of the Royal family, many fear that Georges death is imminent."

This was done as a means to both curtail any upstart princes, as well as to foster a greater familial imperial identity. Though they only carry so much power as their individual offices allow, Council of Five Governors work closely with London and the Crown, although some carry their own personal ambitions.\n\nAppointed in 1917, Prince Albert is the face of the third generation of Victorian Princes, being the first son of Prince George to be appointed within the Council of Five system. Throughout his youth, Albert remained unremarkable and inoffensive, briefly serving as a cadet in the Royal Navy. Seen by London as the most preferable successor after Prince George, Albert's appointment was more a method to keep him safely away from European affairs than anything. He remains a quiet force in American politics, opting to interfere little beyond personal philanthropy and appearences. His most notable achievement continues to be patronage of the medical sciences, attributable to his struggles with hearing loss and lingering respiratory problems from previous typhoid infection."

Arthur's military career made up much of his early life, serving in the Royal Army during the Second and Third Saharan Pacifications, as well as the various Western brushfire wars. Most notably, he commanded troops alongside William Sherman during the Anti-Insurgent Dixie Campaign in 1870. His appointment as Governor General of Quebec would come on the heels of the Great War, as it was hoped his military history and commanding presence would curtail any pro-Paris notions. Though middlingly popular among Quebecois and Anglois-Americans, Arthur remains one of the most popular potential successors should the need arise."

Leopold's appointment came in the midst of the Great War, with London believing that a direct heir as Governor General would bolster Victorian morale in the Australian Campaign. Instead, Leopold's influence became overshadowed by his wife, Daisy Greville. Greville greatly strengthened the Victorian labor party, and numerous philanthropic efforts ingratiated the Governor General to the population. Leopold ultimately shifted away from public life in 1919 following an attempted assassination by the Australien Revanchist Front, while his wife remains an outspoken socialist and suffragette."

Still mourning the death of yet another son, Victoria pushed to have George installed to keep him relatively close to Europe. This was both a pragmatic and emotional decision, as George would be one of the preferred heirs should the need arise. The prince would find it difficult to manage the affairs of the Saharan colony, particularly after the Fatimist Revolutions saw an influx of Spanish and Portuguese refugees. Exacerbating matters was his own son, Edward, who became a source of constant scandal within New Alexandria's elites for his parties and relations. Edward's unofficial exile would weigh heavy on George, and the stresses of helping manage the colony have lead to frequent illness."

Though the increased autonomy of the Commonwealth has lead to the powers and duties of the position of Governor General being somewhat laxed, this is fine by Edward. He is seen by the wider population of the Empire as something of a partygoer, a reputation he is happy to uphold. Often spending his time living the high life, going to social functions and enjoying the various perks that come from his position of royalty. This has understandably done little to bridge the gap between colonised and coloniser. Many of the local American population, especially among the workers and the farmers, grumble in dissent about the lavious lifestyle enjoyed by the Governor General while they work to get meagre plates of food for their families. Though this is little more than complaining in pubs, it certainly does not improve the situation in the Commonwealth."
