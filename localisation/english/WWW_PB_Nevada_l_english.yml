Nevada_War.1.t:0 "One Last Raid from Apacheria"
Nevada_War.1.d:0 "While Nevada's Neighbors have shown nothing, but animosity to the fledgling nation since her birth, one of our oldest enemies is that in Apacheria - a nation who would fight for her land most ferociously. Frequently targeting settlements in both Santa Fe and Nevada.\n\nToday, however, a raid larger than most previously recorded was incited between our two lands. According to eyewitness accounts, a group of Apacheria warriors mistakenly entered our nation's territory, believing they were pursuing a herd of wild game. What was intended as a routine hunting expedition quickly escalated when they encountered members of the Petty Nation, who had been monitoring the area for signs of poaching.\n\nInstead of finding game, the raiding group would find a camping settlement of Nevadans' - fearing for their safety, one of the Nevadans fired a warning shot near the Apache. This would only prove to greatly escalate the situation, whereas the raiding party would hastily proceed to attack the camp, many shots and guns firing following causing a massacre on both sides. \n\nThe event had proved to drastically decrease relations between the two territories, causing many of our politicans and citizens to demand a blood price for the apparent aggressor."

Nevada_War.2.t:0 "The Santa Fe Letter"
Nevada_War.2.d:0 "Today in the city of Albuquerque, a telegram was intercepted on its way to Santa Fe. Planning to propose a joint invasion of the Native Territory of Apacheria.\nThe contents of said letter included:\n\nIn light of recent events that have escalated tensions with the Apacheria Tribe, we propose a strategic alliance for a joint invasion of Apache Territory. The recent violent raid by the Apacheria has demonstrated their unwillingness to coexist peacefully, and we believe decisive action is necessary to protect our interests and assert our sovereignty.\n\nWe propose to mobilize our combined forces to launch an incursion into Apache lands, aiming to secure resources and deter further aggression. We believe that our united front will not only strengthen our position but also send a clear message to the Apacheria about the consequences of their actions.\n\nWe urge your prompt response to discuss this vital matter further. Together, we can restore order and ensure the safety of our peoples.\n\nUnfortunately for the Nevadans, however, such an invasion would prove quite impossible due to the "1880 Apache Accords," not to mention within our lands holds numerable Apache settlers under the protection of the de la O Administration. Our nation has rather quickly responded "No" to such a request."
Nevada_War.2.a:0 "After losing the Northern Territories, can we even afford such a conflict?"

Nevada_War.3.t:0 "Santa Fe's Response"
Nevada_War.3.d:0 "Our request for intervention into the Apache territory from Santa Fe was refused.\n\nOur armed forces are absolutely not in a position to fight them alone without Santa Fe's assistance. Due to such circumstances, Community members in Nevada are expressing their frustrations as well, with some calling for a reevaluation of their relationship with Santa Fe. \n\nAs tensions remain high, the Petty Nation of Nevada is now left to consider its next steps. With the rejection from Santa Fe echoing in their ears, leaders are under pressure to act decisively while navigating the precarious landscape of regional politics. The possibility of unilateral action looms, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for both the nation and the Apacheria Tribe."

Nevada_War.4.t:0 "The 'Atilla del Norte' Answers"
Nevada_War.4.d:0 "Our Western neighbors in California have surprisingly responded to our little Apache Crisis. \n\nPresident Emiliano Zapata of California has extended an offer of military and logistical assistance to the Petty Nation of Nevada amid their ongoing conflict with the Apacheria Tribe. The announcement, made during a press conference on [GetDateText], reflects Zapata's commitment to regional stability and his belief in collective defense.\n\nHowever, such an intervention has been met of course with terms for Nevada. \n\n1. Respect and Autonomy, must be given to Indigenous Land Rights and their Natural Resources.\n\n2.A Socialist, Republican Government must be established in the Republic of Nevada(Elections may be held, but participating parties must meet previous requirements)\n\n3.Nevada must remain in an alliance of mutual defense for a brief period of time.\n\nMany in Nevada view this offer as a much-needed lifeline, restoring hope for a coordinated effort against the Apacheria."

Nevada_War.4.b:0 "We refused to be burdened by California. We will win alone, or not at all!"
