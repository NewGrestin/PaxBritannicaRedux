By using planes and carefully constructed bombshells, we can disperse these microscopic threats among enemy armies."

 bioweapons_anthrax:0 "Breed Anthrax Colonies"
 bioweapons_anthrax_desc:0 "Anthrax is a nasty bacterium. First showing up like a common fever, an airborne strain of anthrax can easily wipe out battalions, wielding a fatality rate of between 60 and 80% when untreated. With the complications of treating anthrax in the field, soldiers can drop like flies when the anthrax bombs are dropped."
 bioweapons_smallpox:0 "Bio-Engineered Smallpox"
 bioweapons_smallpox_desc:0 "Smallpox was the virus that wiped out the Atlantic indians, lacking the immunity of the Old World. This posed the horrifying question: what if we could weaponize smallpox in a similar manner for every man on earth? Thus, bio-engineering produced megapox, a strain of smallpox with a fatality rate reaching the 90%."
 bioweapons_botulism:0 "Botulinum Growth Genome"
 bioweapons_botulism_desc:0 "An unorthodox disease, botulism paralyses the victim in a matter of days. Caused by the bacteria clostridium botulinum, botulism has a small fatality rate but is possible to transmit through soil and water. Deploying such a weapon can thus potentially damage a region for months."

 wmd_livewire:0 "Livewire Deployment"
 wmd_livewire_desc:0 "Livewire is a cruel weapon, having seen deployment during the Great War on both sides. Through biological engineering and early experimentation with amalgamates, livewire became a weapon used on the fronts of Iberia and France. Unlike boring barbed wire, livewire responds to stimulants, like a soldier touching the wire, leading to it wrapping around the poor soul and extensive pressure being put on him, like a boa constrictor with razors across its entire body."

  ## AUGMENTS AND SPECIAL SPECIAL FORCES ##
 hardsuit:0 "Hardsuits"
 hardsuit_desc:0 "Hardsuits were developed near the end of the Great War as a natural evolution of Automat development. Though bulky, these suits allowed the pilot to survive extreme environments and survive kinetic attacks that would decimate conventional troops. A consequence of their use, however, is the need to train and provide therapies to pilots.\n\nThe human brain was simply not designed to handle a second skin, and without proper training and therapy, the suits can be just as dangerous to their user as they are to the enemy. To remedy this, pilots must undergo various surgeries and genetic enhancements to prepare their mind and body to interface with the Hardsuit and truly use it as a heavily militarized second skin."

 razormaiden:0 "Razormaidens"
 razormaiden_desc:0 "Throughout history, women have rarely occupied combat roles. The advent of human augmentation following the Great War changed this paradigm. While never seeing wartime service, the interwar saw many gearheads experiment on themselves, chasing the perpetually unachievable high of being faster, stronger and deadlier.\n\nThis practice lead to the development of Razormaidens, a unique class of special operations units largely composed of heavily augmented women. Every appendage is augmented, turning these units into incredibly fast killing machines, in some instances literally armed to the teeth.\n\nThough unconventional, they outperform standard troops in sheer speed, but the fickle nature of augmentation relegates them to special forces detachments."


 razormaiden_upgrade1:0 "Combat Infiltrator Module"

 razormaiden_upgrade3:0 "Full Body Weaponization"
 razormaiden_upgrade3_desc:0 "Being behind frontlines is a dangerous job, encircled by enemies on all sides. Razormaidens, however, can be specialized in these situations. Through the wonders of modern engineering, an array of guns, blades, ammo and teleforce propelled bullets can be stored inside their body.\n\n"
 razormaiden_upgrade4:0 "Chameleonic Gene Splicing"
 razormaiden_upgrade4_desc:0 "While the Razormaiden is a product of the Automatic revolution, the potential of bio-engineering has not gone unnoticed. As a small step towards further bio-engineering, razormaidens have been augmented with chameleon DNA, allowing these femme fatales to change the colour of their skins to their surroundings.\n\n"
 razormaiden_upgrade5:0 "Modular Bodily Construction"
 razormaiden_upgrade5_desc:0 "Standardization is the language of costs. To standardize the entire body of a razormaiden would allow us greater potential, unlocking the ability to replace losses quickly and without trouble, while improving the integrated skin-armor set of the razormaiden.\n\n"
 razormaiden_upgrade6:0 "Bio-Tech Evolutionary Synthesis"
 razormaiden_upgrade6_desc:0 "Biological engineering and mechanical engineering are children of the same mother and nowhere can this be clearer than with the razormaidens. Through our mastering of bio-engineering, the razormaidens of today can become paintings of biological and mechanical symbiosis.\n\n"

 sos_heavier_armor:0 "Heavier Armor"
 sos_heavier_armor_desc:0 "A heavier armor doctrine centers on the use of heavily armored units, particularly main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, as the primary force in ground combat. This doctrine emphasizes the strategic advantages of superior firepower, protection, and mobility, allowing these units to break through enemy defenses and carry out deep penetration operations.\n\nSupported by artillery and airpower, these mechanized forces are designed to disrupt and destroy enemy command and supply lines, effectively crippling their ability to respond. The doctrine relies on the resilience of heavy armor to withstand enemy attacks while delivering overwhelming force, ensuring the ability to secure and hold critical terrain. It prioritizes the rapid exploitation of breaches, enabling swift and decisive victories in a variety of combat environments."
 sos_more_dakka:0 "Heavier Weapons"
 sos_more_dakka_desc:0 "A doctrine focused on heavier weapons emphasizes the use of large-caliber artillery, long-range missile systems, and heavy firepower as the central element in military operations, in contrast to the mobility and versatility of armored mechanized units. This doctrine prioritizes firepower over mobility, relying on the ability to engage and neutralize enemy forces from a distance through sustained bombardment and precision strikes. Heavier weapons units, such as self-propelled howitzers, rocket artillery, and long-range ballistic systems, serve to soften or annihilate enemy defenses before ground forces engage, minimizing their exposure to risk.\n\nUnlike the heavier armor doctrine, which seeks to break through and dominate via mechanized assault with bulkier, more armored instruments of war, the heavier weapons doctrine focuses on overwhelming the enemy with indirect fire, reducing their combat effectiveness before maneuver elements advance to secure objectives. This approach tends to be more static but highly effective in shaping the battlefield from a distance."

 faf_fire_and_fury:0 "Fire and Fury"
 faf_fire_and_fury_desc:0 "A military doctrine focused on artillery supremacy emphasizes the central role of massed, sustained artillery fire to dominate the battlefield and weaken the enemy before direct engagements. This doctrine relies on the overwhelming firepower of a wide range of artillery systems, including howitzers, rocket launchers, and long-range precision missiles, to disrupt enemy formations, destroy fortifications, and suppress counterattacks. Artillery is used as the decisive factor in shaping the battlefield by neutralizing enemy forces at a distance, creating favorable conditions for advancing infantry or armored units."
 faf_fuller_auto:0 "Fuller Auto"
 faf_fuller_auto_desc:0 "In the Great War, a common deciding factor in the outcome of a battle was manpower. Whichever side had more bodies to throw usually ended up winning. Various technological advances have given options to mitigate this but it still remains a major factor. With the introduction of the 'Fuller Auto' system we can overcome this. By increasing the rate of fire of our heavy guns, any hostile assault will be severely delayed if not stopped outright before they reach our front lines."
 faf_beans_and_butter:0 "Beans, Butter and Bullets"
 faf_beans_and_butter_desc:0 "As the needs of a heavily armed, semi-static force grow, maintaining supply lines is even more important. In addition to shells, our troops need the four basic food groups: beans, bacon, whiskey and lard."
 faf_more_firepower:0 "Weaponized Pyromania"
 faf_more_firepower_desc:0 "A doctrine add-on focused on disabling safety protocols on automatic weapons to increase firepower, often referred to as "overclocking" or bypassing fire rate limiters, aims to maximize the volume of fire in short bursts, particularly in close-quarters combat or high-intensity firefights. By disabling certain safety mechanisms, automatic weapons can fire more rounds in less time, theoretically increasing the chance of hitting targets and delivering overwhelming suppressive fire. However, this comes at the cost of reduced weapon longevity, increased overheating, and a higher risk of malfunctions.\n\nThis add-on would be most effective in scenarios where overwhelming firepower is needed to quickly overwhelm an enemy force, though it would require highly trained operators capable of managing the risks associated with weapon degradation and increased recoil. The doctrine would prioritize short-term tactical gains over long-term sustainability of equipment, making it suitable for elite or specialized units where rapid, overwhelming engagements are critical."
 faf_combat_team_organization:0 "Streamlined Stimulant Distribution"
 faf_combat_team_organization_desc:0 "Improving the efficiency of distributing stimulants to frontline soldiers is designed to enhance combat performance, endurance, and alertness during prolonged engagements or high-stress operations. This approach would involve streamlined logistical systems for the rapid and controlled distribution of performance-enhancing drugs, such as stimulants that increase focus, reduce fatigue, and sharpen reaction times. Innovations could include the integration of stimulants into rations, portable dispensers, or wearable delivery systems, ensuring that soldiers can access the substances as needed without logistical delays.\n\nThe doctrine emphasizes maintaining operational readiness during extended combat operations by managing fatigue and boosting morale, while also implementing safeguards to prevent overuse, addiction, or impaired judgment. This would be particularly valuable in high-intensity, continuous operations where physical and mental exhaustion could critically impact mission success. However, the doctrine would require strict oversight to manage the ethical and health implications of widespread stimulant use."
 faf_thunder_runs:0 "Thunder Runs"
 faf_thunder_runs_desc:0 "Thunder Runs adopt rolling artillery bombardment emphasizing continuous, synchronized artillery fire that move progressively ahead of advancing ground forces to suppress and disorient enemy defenses. This approach, often referred to as a "creeping barrage," ensures that as infantry or armored units move forward, they are shielded by a curtain of artillery fire that clears obstacles, disrupts enemy positions, and neutralizes threats before the advancing units engage. The rolling bombardment creates a dynamic battlefield environment where the enemy has little time to recover or regroup, maintaining constant pressure.\n\nPrecision timing and coordination between artillery and ground forces are crucial, ensuring that the bombardment stays just ahead of friendly troops while keeping the enemy under relentless attack. This doctrine requires advanced targeting systems, well-trained artillery crews, and communication networks to ensure synchronization, but when executed effectively, it provides a powerful method of sustaining momentum in offensive operations while minimizing casualties among advancing forces."
 faf_automated_targeting:0 "Thinker Targeting Systems"
 faf_automated_targeting_desc:0 "Thinker Targeting Systems are constructed intelligence (CI) automatons to manage targeting systems focuses on integrating CI to enhance precision, speed, and adaptability in battlefield engagements. CI-driven targeting systems would analyze vast amounts of real-time data from sensors, drones, and reconnaissance units, allowing for faster identification of enemy positions, prioritization of targets, and optimal allocation of firepower. These systems could adjust targeting parameters on the fly, accounting for changing battlefield conditions such as terrain, enemy movements, and environmental factors.\n\nThe CI would enable more accurate strikes with reduced collateral damage, especially in complex, high-density environments. Furthermore, it could autonomously assign fire missions, ensuring that artillery, air support, or precision-guided munitions are deployed in the most efficient manner possible. This doctrine add-on would drastically reduce human error and decision-making delays while enabling forces to respond rapidly to emerging threats. However, it would also require rigorous safeguards to prevent malfunctions or unintended engagements, along with strong measures to protect against potential adversary interference."
 faf_drone_targeting:0 "Drone Coordination"
 faf_drone_targeting_desc:0 "Using aerial surveillance drones to monitor the battlefield focuses on leveraging real-time, high-resolution intelligence gathered from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to enhance situational awareness and decision-making. This approach integrates drones at various altitudes and endurance levels, providing constant coverage of key areas of interest, such as enemy movements, supply routes, and strategic positions. These drones, equipped with advanced sensors—such as thermal imaging, infrared, and high-definition cameras—can detect hidden or camouflaged forces, monitor changes in terrain, and track the progress of friendly units. The intelligence collected by drones is relayed in real-time to command centers and frontline units, allowing for rapid adjustments to tactics, airstrikes, or artillery support.\n\nThis constant aerial surveillance significantly reduces the risk of ambushes, enhances the precision of strikes, and enables commanders to make informed decisions with a clear, up-to-date view of the battlefield. By integrating drones into the core of reconnaissance and target acquisition efforts, this doctrine improves both offensive and defensive operations, increasing the overall effectiveness and safety of military engagements."
 faf_shock_and_awe:0 "Shock and Awe"
 faf_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Undermining enemy morale through sheer firepower emphasizes the psychological impact of overwhelming, continuous, and devastating attacks to break the enemy's will to fight. This approach combines massed artillery, airstrikes, and heavy weapons to create an unrelenting barrage that leaves the enemy with little time to regroup or recover. By maintaining constant pressure, the enemy's sense of security and cohesion is eroded, leading to confusion, fear, and diminished combat effectiveness. The goal is to not only inflict physical damage but to demoralize enemy forces by demonstrating overwhelming superiority, making them believe that resistance is futile.\n\nThis doctrine would leverage the shock-and-awe effect, where the intensity and scale of firepower cause disorganization and panic, encouraging surrender or retreat. Additionally, it integrates psychological operations (PSYOPS) alongside the firepower to maximize the emotional and mental toll on the enemy, ensuring that even if they survive the bombardment, their morale is too broken to continue effective resistance."
 faf_firestorm_assaults: "Firestorm Assaults"
 faf_firestorm_assaults_desc: "Since ancient times, fire has been a devastating weapon against most foes. Even as its continued usage became increasingly controversal in the international community, the strategic value of such weapons remains clear. Forestorm Assaults, as the name implies, makes heavy use of incendiary weapons. Not only devastating entire squads of soldiers but crippling the morale of the survivors."
 faf_burnout_doctrine:0 "Burn Em' Out"
 faf_burnout_doctrine_desc:0 "Improving the quality of flamethrower technology focuses on enhancing the range, fuel efficiency, and safety of these weapons to make them more versatile and effective in modern combat. Advances in fuel composition could allow for longer-range streams of flame, extending the reach and lethality of the weapon while reducing the risk to operators. Improvements in ignition systems, fuel storage, and delivery mechanisms would make flamethrowers more reliable, lighter, and safer to use, allowing for better maneuverability in urban, jungle, or bunker-clearing operations. Enhanced heat-resistant materials could further protect operators from potential backblast or weapon malfunctions.\n\nThis upgraded flamethrower technology would be especially valuable in close-quarters combat, clearing fortified positions, and psychologically impacting enemy forces through the fear and destructive power associated with fire. The doctrine would also integrate flamethrower units with other mechanized and infantry forces to exploit its effectiveness in specific tactical scenarios, providing a specialized tool for breaching entrenched defenses or denying enemies cover in difficult terrain."
 faf_indiscriminate_fire:0 "Indiscriminate Assault"
 faf_indiscriminate_fire_desc:0 "A military strategy centered on indiscriminately bombarding enemy positions prioritizes maximum destruction over precision to overwhelm and incapacitate opposing forces. This approach involves unleashing heavy artillery, airstrikes, and rocket barrages on enemy territories with minimal regard for specific targets, aiming to saturate the area with firepower. By flooding the battlefield with relentless bombardment, the goal is to ensure no enemy strongholds, supply routes, or hidden forces can survive or regroup.\n\nThis tactic seeks to maximize efficiency by creating an environment where enemy forces are constantly under threat, unable to mount coordinated resistance or counterattacks. While this method may cause significant collateral damage, it is employed to achieve rapid dominance, using overwhelming force to break the enemy's capacity to fight and leaving them too scattered or disorganized to continue effective operations."
 faf_combined_arms_warfare:0 "Combined Arms Warfare"
 faf_combined_arms_warfare_desc:0 "Combined arms warfare is a military strategy that integrates different types of combat units—such as infantry, armor (tanks), artillery, and air support—into a cohesive operation to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. This approach allows forces to exploit the complementary capabilities of each unit type: infantry can secure and hold ground, tanks provide mobile firepower and protection, artillery offers long-range bombardment, and air support delivers precision strikes.\n\nBy coordinating these elements, a military force can create overwhelming pressure on the enemy, making it difficult for them to respond effectively and increasing the chances of achieving strategic objectives. The concept of combined arms warfare has evolved over time, but it remains a cornerstone of modern military doctrine, emphasizing the importance of coordination, timing, and flexibility on the battlefield."

 cof_cult_of_the_offensive_desc:0 "Though technology and tactics have changed over the centuries, one fact remains absolute. Wars are won not by machines, but by men. It is men who will lead us to victory, and our combat doctrine must reflect this. Even the most powerful tanks, aircraft and fleet can be destroyed by simple Infantry if given the right equipment. It's imperative that this idea be maintained and expanded upon."

 cof_infiltration_troops_desc:0 "While massive assaults and vast fortifications are of course an important part of any campaign, the role of the few cannot be over looked. Deployed with precision and possessing highly specialised training, our infilitration squads can sneak through the enemy's front lines. Once there they can wreck havoc that would normally cost hundreds to lives to achieve conventionally."

 cof_hindenburg_doctrine_desc:0 "While it is said that the best defence is a good offence, that does not mean we should disregard defensive tactics completely. Our souls must be trained in how to create entrenchments and temporary fortifications both quickly and effectively. If done well, this will allow our soldiers to consolidate their control over territory they have occupied. Or at least hold it until more permeant defences and garrison forces can be sent in."
 cof_bullard_doctrine:0 "Bullard-Haig Doctrine"
 cof_bullard_doctrine_desc:0 "A wise man once said that best defence is a good offence, and the static lines of the Great War have proved the results of just digging in and waiting. Our military must be one of action, not patience. Our soldiers must be taught to attack enemy lines in the most effective way possible. Exploting gaps and weakened parts of it in order to achieve crtiical breakthroughs that shall leave our forces to victory."
