  chemweapons_basic_psychadelic_desc:0 "Ranging from concentrated chemicals made in labs to experimentation with natural resources  like toloache, ketamine and mushrooms, hallucinogens allow us to neutralize an enemy without much harm. By feeding the dark sides of  the mind with these chemicals, soldiers can turn paranoid and delirious, exhibiting complications comparable to clinical insanity."
 
  chemweapons_advanced_irritant:0 "Pseudo-Incendary Inhalants"
  chemweapons_advanced_irritant_desc:0 "The next step in irritation chemicals, pseudo-incendary inhalants creates a special chemical  burn that sticks to the inside of a victim's lungs. The feeling of a chemical burn on the inside of their lungs is often enough to  neutralize a target, as treatment of the chemical attack can take months."
  chemweapons_advanced_choking_agent:0 "Caustic Inhalants"
  chemweapons_advanced_choking_agent_desc:0 "Chemicals that are caustic or errosive damage tissue or property through contact with  other chemicals, often oxygen.

By using planes and carefully constructed bombshells, we can  disperse these microscopic threats among enemy armies."
 
  bioweapons_anthrax:0 "Breed Anthrax Colonies"
  bioweapons_anthrax_desc:0 "Anthrax is a nasty bacterium. First showing up like a common fever, an airborne strain of anthrax can  easily wipe out battalions, wielding a fatality rate of between 60 and 80% when untreated. With the complications of treating  anthrax in the field, soldiers can drop like flies when the anthrax bombs are dropped."
  bioweapons_smallpox:0 "Bio-Engineered Smallpox"
  bioweapons_smallpox_desc:0 "Smallpox was the virus that wiped out the Atlantic indians, lacking the immunity of the Old World. This  posed the horrifying question: what if we could weaponize smallpox in a similar manner for every man on earth? Thus, bio-engineering  produced megapox, a strain of smallpox with a fatality rate reaching the 90%."
  bioweapons_botulism:0 "Botulinum Growth Genome"
  bioweapons_botulism_desc:0 "An unorthodox disease, botulism paralyses the victim in a matter of days. Caused by the bacteria  clostridium botulinum, botulism has a small fatality rate but is possible to transmit through soil and water. Deploying such a  weapon can thus potentially damage a region for months."
  bioweapons_Influenza:0 "Influenza Variant Testing"

  wmd_livewire:0 "Livewire Deployment"
  wmd_livewire_desc:0 "Livewire is a cruel weapon, having seen deployment during the Great War on both sides. Through biological  engineering and early experimentation with amalgamates, livewire became a weapon used on the fronts of Iberia and France. Unlike  boring barbed wire, livewire responds to stimulants, like a soldier touching the wire, leading to it wrapping around the poor soul  and extensive pressure being put on him, like a boa constrictor with razors across its entire body."

   ## AUGMENTS AND SPECIAL SPECIAL FORCES ##
  hardsuit:0 "Hardsuits"
  hardsuit_desc:0 "Hardsuits were developed near the end of the Great War as a natural evolution of Automat development. Though bulky,  these suits allowed the pilot to survive extreme environments and survive kinetic attacks that would decimate conventional troops. A  consequence of their use, however, is the need to train and provide therapies to pilots.\n\nThe human brain was simply not designed  to handle a second skin, and without proper training and therapy, the suits can be just as dangerous to their user as they are to  the enemy. To remedy this, pilots must undergo various surgeries and genetic enhancements to prepare their mind and body to  interface with the Hardsuit and truly use it as a heavily militarized second skin."

  razormaiden:0 "Razormaidens"
  razormaiden_desc:0 "Throughout history, women have rarely occupied combat roles. The advent of human augmentation following the  Great War changed this paradigm. While never seeing wartime service, the interwar saw many gearheads experiment on themselves,  chasing the perpetually unachievable high of being faster, stronger and deadlier.\n\nThis practice lead to the development of  Razormaidens, a unique class of special operations units largely composed of heavily augmented women. Every appendage is augmented,  turning these units into incredibly fast killing machines, in some instances literally armed to the teeth.\n\nThough unconventional,  they outperform standard troops in sheer speed, but the fickle nature of augmentation relegates them to special forces detachments."
 
 
  razormaiden_upgrade1:0 "Combat Infiltrator Module"
  razormaiden_upgrade1_desc:0 "Designed to be more able in the infiltration behind enemy lines, combat infiltrator modules are special  upgrades for razormaidens seeking to act as special ops. Expanding their range of motion, the razormaiden is more able to move  silently. \n\n"

  razormaiden_upgrade3:0 "Full Body Weaponization"
  razormaiden_upgrade3_desc:0 "Being behind frontlines is a dangerous job, encircled by enemies on all sides. Razormaidens, however,  can be specialized in these situations. Through the wonders of modern engineering, an array of guns, blades, ammo and teleforce  propelled bullets can be stored inside their body.\n\n"
  razormaiden_upgrade4:0 "Chameleonic Gene Splicing"
  razormaiden_upgrade4_desc:0 "While the Razormaiden is a product of the Automatic revolution, the potential of bio-engineering has  not gone unnoticed. As a small step towards further bio-engineering, razormaidens have been augmented with chameleon DNA, allowing  these femme fatales to change the colour of their skins to their surroundings.\n\n"
  razormaiden_upgrade5:0 "Modular Bodily Construction"
  razormaiden_upgrade5_desc:0 "Standardization is the language of costs. To standardize the entire body of a razormaiden would allow  us greater potential, unlocking the ability to replace losses quickly and without trouble, while improving the integrated skin-armor  set of the razormaiden.\n\n"
  razormaiden_upgrade6:0 "Bio-Tech Evolutionary Synthesis"
  razormaiden_upgrade6_desc:0 "Biological engineering and mechanical engineering are children of the same mother and nowhere can this  be clearer than with the razormaidens.

  sos_more_dakka_desc:0 "A doctrine focused on heavier weapons emphasizes the use of large-caliber artillery, long-range missile  systems, and heavy firepower as the central element in military operations, in contrast to the mobility and versatility of armored  mechanized units. This doctrine prioritizes firepower over mobility, relying on the ability to engage and neutralize enemy forces  from a distance through sustained bombardment and precision strikes. Heavier weapons units, such as self-propelled howitzers, rocket  artillery, and long-range ballistic systems, serve to soften or annihilate enemy defenses before ground forces engage, minimizing  their exposure to risk.\n\nUnlike the heavier armor doctrine, which seeks to break through and dominate via mechanized assault with  bulkier, more armored instruments of war, the heavier weapons doctrine focuses on overwhelming the enemy with indirect fire,  reducing their combat effectiveness before maneuver elements advance to secure objectives. This approach tends to be more static but  highly effective in shaping the battlefield from a distance."

  faf_more_firepower_desc:0 "A doctrine add-on focused on disabling safety protocols on automatic weapons to increase firepower, often  referred to as "overclocking" or bypassing fire rate limiters, aims to maximize the volume of fire in short bursts, particularly in  close-quarters combat or high-intensity firefights. By disabling certain safety mechanisms, automatic weapons can fire more rounds  in less time, theoretically increasing the chance of hitting targets and delivering overwhelming suppressive fire. However, this  comes at the cost of reduced weapon longevity, increased overheating, and a higher risk of malfunctions.\n\nThis add-on would be  most effective in scenarios where overwhelming firepower is needed to quickly overwhelm an enemy force, though it would require  highly trained operators capable of managing the risks associated with weapon degradation and increased recoil. The doctrine would  prioritize short-term tactical gains over long-term sustainability of equipment, making it suitable for elite or specialized units  where rapid, overwhelming engagements are critical."

This approach would  involve streamlined logistical systems for the rapid and controlled distribution of performance-enhancing drugs, such as stimulants  that increase focus, reduce fatigue, and sharpen reaction times. Innovations could include the integration of stimulants into  rations, portable dispensers, or wearable delivery systems, ensuring that soldiers can access the substances as needed without  logistical delays.\n\nThe doctrine emphasizes maintaining operational readiness during extended combat operations by managing  fatigue and boosting morale, while also implementing safeguards to prevent overuse, addiction, or impaired judgment. This would be  particularly valuable in high-intensity, continuous operations where physical and mental exhaustion could critically impact mission  success. However, the doctrine would require strict oversight to manage the ethical and health implications of widespread stimulant  use."
  faf_thunder_runs:0 "Thunder Runs"
  faf_thunder_runs_desc:0 "Thunder Runs adopt rolling artillery bombardment emphasizing continuous, synchronized artillery fire that  move progressively ahead of advancing ground forces to suppress and disorient enemy defenses. This approach, often referred to as a  "creeping barrage," ensures that as infantry or armored units move forward, they are shielded by a curtain of artillery fire that  clears obstacles, disrupts enemy positions, and neutralizes threats before the advancing units engage. The rolling bombardment  creates a dynamic battlefield environment where the enemy has little time to recover or regroup, maintaining constant pressure. \n\nPrecision timing and coordination between artillery and ground forces are crucial, ensuring that the bombardment stays just  ahead of friendly troops while keeping the enemy under relentless attack. This doctrine requires advanced targeting systems,  well-trained artillery crews, and communication networks to ensure synchronization, but when executed effectively, it provides a  powerful method of sustaining momentum in offensive operations while minimizing casualties among advancing forces."

CI-driven targeting systems  would analyze vast amounts of real-time data from sensors, drones, and reconnaissance units, allowing for faster identification of  enemy positions, prioritization of targets, and optimal allocation of firepower. These systems could adjust targeting parameters on  the fly, accounting for changing battlefield conditions such as terrain, enemy movements, and environmental factors.\n\nThe CI would  enable more accurate strikes with reduced collateral damage, especially in complex, high-density environments. Furthermore, it could  autonomously assign fire missions, ensuring that artillery, air support, or precision-guided munitions are deployed in the most  efficient manner possible. This doctrine add-on would drastically reduce human error and decision-making delays while enabling  forces to respond rapidly to emerging threats. However, it would also require rigorous safeguards to prevent malfunctions or  unintended engagements, along with strong measures to protect against potential adversary interference."
  faf_drone_targeting:0 "Drone Coordination"
  faf_drone_targeting_desc:0 "Using aerial surveillance drones to monitor the battlefield focuses on leveraging real-time,  high-resolution intelligence gathered from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to enhance situational awareness and decision-making. This  approach integrates drones at various altitudes and endurance levels, providing constant coverage of key areas of interest, such as  enemy movements, supply routes, and strategic positions. These drones, equipped with advanced sensors—such as thermal imaging,  infrared, and high-definition cameras—can detect hidden or camouflaged forces, monitor changes in terrain, and track the progress of  friendly units. The intelligence collected by drones is relayed in real-time to command centers and frontline units, allowing for  rapid adjustments to tactics, airstrikes, or artillery support.\n\nThis constant aerial surveillance significantly reduces the risk  of ambushes, enhances the precision of strikes, and enables commanders to make informed decisions with a clear, up-to-date view of  the battlefield. By integrating drones into the core of reconnaissance and target acquisition efforts, this doctrine improves both  offensive and defensive operations, increasing the overall effectiveness and safety of military engagements."
  faf_shock_and_awe:0 "Shock and Awe"
  faf_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Undermining enemy morale through sheer firepower emphasizes the psychological impact of overwhelming,  continuous, and devastating attacks to break the enemy's will to fight. This approach combines massed artillery, airstrikes, and  heavy weapons to create an unrelenting barrage that leaves the enemy with little time to regroup or recover. By maintaining constant  pressure, the enemy's sense of security and cohesion is eroded, leading to confusion, fear, and diminished combat effectiveness. The  goal is to not only inflict physical damage but to demoralize enemy forces by demonstrating overwhelming superiority, making them  believe that resistance is futile.\n\nThis doctrine would leverage the shock-and-awe effect, where the intensity and scale of  firepower cause disorganization and panic, encouraging surrender or retreat. Additionally, it integrates psychological operations  (PSYOPS) alongside the firepower to maximize the emotional and mental toll on the enemy, ensuring that even if they survive the  bombardment, their morale is too broken to continue effective resistance."
  faf_firestorm_assaults: "Firestorm Assaults"
  faf_firestorm_assaults_desc: "Since ancient times, fire has been a devastating weapon against most foes. Even as its continued usage  became increasingly controversal in the international community, the strategic value of such weapons remains clear. Forestorm  Assaults, as the name implies, makes heavy use of incendiary weapons. Not only devastating entire squads of soldiers but crippling  the morale of the survivors."
  faf_burnout_doctrine:0 "Burn Em' Out"
  faf_burnout_doctrine_desc:0 "Improving the quality of flamethrower technology focuses on enhancing the range, fuel efficiency, and  safety of these weapons to make them more versatile and effective in modern combat. Advances in fuel composition could allow for  longer-range streams of flame, extending the reach and lethality of the weapon while reducing the risk to operators. Improvements in  ignition systems, fuel storage, and delivery mechanisms would make flamethrowers more reliable, lighter, and safer to use, allowing  for better maneuverability in urban, jungle, or bunker-clearing operations. Enhanced heat-resistant materials could further protect  operators from potential backblast or weapon malfunctions.\n\nThis upgraded flamethrower technology would be especially valuable in  close-quarters combat, clearing fortified positions, and psychologically impacting enemy forces through the fear and destructive  power associated with fire. The doctrine would also integrate flamethrower units with other mechanized and infantry forces to  exploit its effectiveness in specific tactical scenarios, providing a specialized tool for breaching entrenched defenses or denying  enemies cover in difficult terrain."
  faf_indiscriminate_fire:0 "Indiscriminate Assault"
  faf_indiscriminate_fire_desc:0 "A military strategy centered on indiscriminately bombarding enemy positions prioritizes maximum  destruction over precision to overwhelm and incapacitate opposing forces. This approach involves unleashing heavy artillery,  airstrikes, and rocket barrages on enemy territories with minimal regard for specific targets, aiming to saturate the area with  firepower. By flooding the battlefield with relentless bombardment, the goal is to ensure no enemy strongholds, supply routes, or  hidden forces can survive or regroup.\n\nThis tactic seeks to maximize efficiency by creating an environment where enemy forces are  constantly under threat, unable to mount coordinated resistance or counterattacks. While this method may cause significant  collateral damage, it is employed to achieve rapid dominance, using overwhelming force to break the enemy's capacity to fight and  leaving them too scattered or disorganized to continue effective operations."
  faf_combined_arms_warfare:0 "Combined Arms Warfare"
  faf_combined_arms_warfare_desc:0 "Combined arms warfare is a military strategy that integrates different types of combat units—such  as infantry, armor (tanks), artillery, and air support—into a cohesive operation to maximize their strengths and minimize their  weaknesses. This approach allows forces to exploit the complementary capabilities of each unit type: infantry can secure and hold  ground, tanks provide mobile firepower and protection, artillery offers long-range bombardment, and air support delivers precision  strikes.\n\nBy coordinating these elements, a military force can create overwhelming pressure on the enemy, making it difficult for  them to respond effectively and increasing the chances of achieving strategic objectives. The concept of combined arms warfare has  evolved over time, but it remains a cornerstone of modern military doctrine, emphasizing the importance of coordination, timing, and  flexibility on the battlefield."

  cof_cult_of_the_offensive_desc:0 "Though technology and tactics have changed over the centuries, one fact remains absolute. Wars are  won not by machines, but by men. It is men who will lead us to victory, and our combat doctrine must reflect this. Even the most  powerful tanks, aircraft and fleet can be destroyed by simple Infantry if given the right equipment. It's imperative that this idea  be maintained and expanded upon."

Deployed with precision and possessing highly specialised training, our infilitration squads  can sneak through the enemy's front lines. Once there they can wreck havoc that would normally cost hundreds to lives to achieve  conventionally."

Our souls must be trained in how to create entrenchments and temporary fortifications both quickly and  effectively. If done well, this will allow our soldiers to consolidate their control over territory they have occupied. Or at least  hold it until more permeant defences and garrison forces can be sent in."

Our military must be one of action, not patience. Our soldiers must be taught to  attack enemy lines in the most effective way possible. Exploting gaps and weakened parts of it in order to achieve crtiical  breakthroughs that shall leave our forces to victory."
