  augmented:0 "Augmented"
  augmented_desc:0 "This general has been biomechanically enhanced, either as a medical necessity or to improve combat performance. While this improves aspects of physical and mental performance, human augmentation is not an exact science and users require regular genetic therapy to prevent Acute Bodily Rejection Syndrome and septic illness."
  razormaiden:0 "Razormaiden"
  shellshocked:0 "Shellshocked"
  shellshocked_desc:0 "This general suffers from Acute Battle Fatigue Syndrome, colloquially known as Shellshock or Combat Nerves.\n\nWhile this condition has always existed historically, the volume of cases caused during the Great War lead it to be officially recognized by the International Psychiatric Treatment Foundation in the IMCD-23. Official description and diagnosis has done little to break down the social stigma of ABFS, and most refuse to acknowledge and treat symptoms outside extreme cases."

  Iberian_Front_Veteran:0 "Veteran of the Iberian Campaign"
  Iberian_Front_Veteran_desc:0 "This general served with the British Expeditionary Force during the Iberian Campaign.\n\nNotable for being the first instance of combined arms combat during Operation Overlord, the Iberian Campaign was one of the most arduous frontlines of the entire Great War. Despite being outmatched by technologically superior Anglo-American forces, the Royal Spanish Army fought a bitter retreat across Asturias and the Basque Country before frontlines calcified along the Cantabrian Mountain range.\n\nThe Iberian Front would become a meat grinder as Anglo-American Forces pressed South in any available direction. While air support and overwhelming firepower helped to break Spanish fortifications, the Spanish often countered with chemical weapons and massed infantry assaults, demonstrating an almost comical disregard for the losses they suffered.\n\nMost infamously, the Iberian Campaign is remembered for the Battle of Valladolid, simultaneously a success for combined arms warfare and one of the worst atrocities in British military history. Desperate to hold the line, Spanish commanders refused to allow civilians to evacuate and in many cases even forced them to organize protective militias. Unaware of this, British commanders rained steel hell on the city, pummeling it with caustic chemical bombs and incendiary rounds.\n\nUltimately over half the city's pre-war population was killed, along with around 25,000 Spanish soldiers. As a result, the Iberian Campaign occupies a contradictory role in Britain's military history as both a triumph and an irremovable black mark against her military reputation."
  egotist:0 "Egotistical"

  Siberian_Front_Veteran:0 "Veteran of the Siberian War"
  Siberian_Front_Veteran_desc:0 "The Siberian War is the colloquial term for the Siberian Front during the Great War.\n\nPrincipally between the Russian and Japanese Empires, the Siberian Front saw some of the most intense, bitter fighting of the entire war. Russian forces initially underestimated the military capacity of the Japanese, resulting in a series of major defeats and the Siege of Vladivostok. Emboldened by their initial gains, the Japanese pushed to the Amur River, spending the remainder of that year’s winter fortifying in expectation of a Russian counteroffensive. Russia opted to circumvent the Japanese and moved forces through neutral Manchuria, securing control over the Trans-Siberian Railway and pressuring Japan’s occupation of Korea.\n\nUltimately the intervention of the Anglo-German Naval Blockade sapped the IJA’s ability to prosecute the war, forcing them into a fighting retreat across the Far East. Vladivostok, though it never officially fell, was liberated from the stagnant Japanese siege in 1908. Japanese forces continued fighting tenaciously until the final defeat at Busan, where the IJA officially surrendered to the Russian Empire. Irregular fighting continued for years after, however, as many Japanese troops refused to acknowledge the surrender orders, with the ongoing Japanese Revolution exacerbating matters."
  suspected_moscow_circle:0 "Suspected Moscow Circle Acolyte"
  suspected_moscow_circle_desc:0 "The Moscow Circle is the name given to an almost invisible secondary organ of the Russian Armed forces. The exact circumstances under which it was founded are unknown, it is unknown who leads the group, and it is unknown how many members it contains. All that is known to the Russian Intelligence Services is that the Circle are a faction of arch-reactionaries and ultranationalists, dedicated to worming their way into the nascent democratic government to undermine and ultimately dismantle it.\n\nThe Circle is extremely elusive, and the intelligence services only have a vague idea of who may or may not be part of the organization. The insular nature of the group and the self-protecting nature of the Russian military have made attempts at infiltration exceptionally difficult. All that can be said for certain is the Moscow Circle exists, and it has likely infected many higher levels of the Russian military."
