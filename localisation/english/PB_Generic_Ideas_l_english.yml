  PB_Idea_Untamed_Frontier_desc:0 "The Western frontier of North America is, in some ways, one of the last untamed lands on Earth. Though it has been settled, vast territories of the region remain untappped by industrialization. Times are changing, however, and the relentless march of industry continues. Every day new rail lines are laid down, every day another mine or oil concern opens, and every day the West becomes less wild."

  PB_Colonial_Insurrection_desc:0 "This nation is a colony or administrative subdivision of another nation, currently combatting a localized uprising. Due to the less severe nature and lower intensity nature of the conflict, the scope of the war is kept at a local level."
  PB_Automation_Crisis_Dynamic_Modifier:0 "The Automation Crisis"
  PB_Automation_Crisis_Dynamic_Modifier_desc:0 "During the Great War, most of the Empire's sons were busy marching through the hell of Northern Spain, leaving our industrial jobs empty. Though women were allowed into the workforce, there still remained a social stigma against the idea, leading the nation's leaders to search elsewhere. The solution came, as always, from the Edison Imperial Electric Company.\n\nIn the technological pressure cooker of the war, Edison Electric used their status as an Imperial Corporation to rapidly develop a series of minimal human involvement industrial machines. These allowed a relatively small amount of workers to do the job of a hundred, or even a thousand. Arguably, the effect on British and intra-imperial industrial output was a critical factor in winning the war.\n\nUndisputably, this factor also retarded our economic recovery afterwards. Emergency measures are difficult to undo, and with Edison's economic monopoly, automation programs escalated. With the Great Welsh Coal Crisis, things have boiled over, and we face a massive unemployment problem despite the economy still chugging along. Protests and riots are becoming commonplace, and society is becoming divided amongst those who have already been automated, may be automated, and who cannot be automated."
