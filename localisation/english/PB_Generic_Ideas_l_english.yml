  PB_Idea_Untamed_Frontier:0 "The Untamed Frontier"
  PB_Idea_Untamed_Frontier_desc:0 "The Western frontier of North America is, in some ways, one of the last untamed lands on Earth. Though it has been settled, vast territories of the region remain untappped by industrialization. Times are changing, however, and the relentless march of industry continues. Every day new rail lines are laid down, every day another mine or oil concern opens, and every day the West becomes less wild."

  PB_Colonial_Insurrection_desc:0 "This nation is a colony or administrative subdivision of another nation, currently combatting a localized uprising. Due to the less severe nature and lower intensity nature of the conflict, the scope of the war is kept at a local level."
  PB_Automation_Crisis_Dynamic_Modifier:0 "The Automation Crisis"
  PB_Automation_Crisis_Dynamic_Modifier_desc:0 "During the Great War, most of the Empire's sons were busy marching through the hell of Northern Spain, leaving our industrial jobs empty. Though women were allowed into the workforce, there still remained a social stigma against the idea, leading the nation's leaders to search elsewhere. The solution came, as always, from the Edison Imperial Electric Company.\n\nIn the technological pressure cooker of the war, Edison Electric used their status as an Imperial Corporation to rapidly develop a series of minimal human involvement industrial machines. These allowed a relatively small amount of workers to do the job of a hundred, or even a thousand. Arguably, the effect on British and intra-imperial industrial output was a critical factor in winning the war.\n\nUndisputably, this factor also retarded our economic recovery afterwards. Emergency measures are difficult to undo, and with Edison's economic monopoly, automation programs escalated. With the Great Welsh Coal Crisis, things have boiled over, and we face a massive unemployment problem despite the economy still chugging along. Protests and riots are becoming commonplace, and society is becoming divided amongst those who have already been automated, may be automated, and who cannot be automated."

  PB_Idea_PHI_Rebellion:0 "The War of Liberation"
  PB_Idea_PHI_Rebellion_desc:0 "From 1896 to the present day, no foreign occupier—whether Spanish, British, German, or otherwise — has ever found peace in these lands. Relentless warfare has rendered any standing infrastructure temporary at best. To each soldier who marches toward Manila, peace will remain an unattainable dream, and sleep a fleeting luxury. To each soldier who marches in its defense, freedom will not be obtained by simply defending those you love. And to anyone who marches at all?, they must be prepared to leap into the abyss."
  PB_Idea_PHI_Mexicandive:0 "The Mexican Helldive"
  PB_Idea_PHI_Mexicandive_desc:0 "In the midst of The Great War, as former Spanish colonies fell into disarray, Mexico saw an opportunity to assert itself. With the dream of restoring the Galleon Trade and expanding its influence, Mexico began funneling weapons and sending air squadrons to support the Philippine Revolution. driven by a desire to gain a foothold in the Pacific and re-establish Mexico’s imperial ambitions, hoping to resurrect a glorious past long lost. In the end, Mexico’s efforts would bear little fruit. The grand gamble to reassert its imperial ambitions through the Philippine Revolution collapsed under its own weight. The homeland, already in disarray, was unable to sustain the program. Resources dried up, and the Mexican planes that once soared over the skies in support of the revolution now lay dormant on forgotten airstrips, gathering dust."
  PB_Idea_PHI_FirstBloom:0 "First Asian Bloom"
  PB_Idea_PHI_FirstBloom_desc:0 "The Philippine Republic is one of, if not the first of its kind in the Orient — a shining red beacon in an otherwise feudal continent. Despite the many successes of its northern neighbors, if the Asian race is to truly seek its own destiny, its first flower, before many others, must finally be ready to bloom."
