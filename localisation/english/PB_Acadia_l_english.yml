LYONS_DESC:0 "Charlton Lyons grew up in the south of Louisiana as son of an Anglophone family connected to the banking industry through his maternal grandfather. Having studied law in Winnfield and Shreveport, Lyons became involved with the Progressive Party in the 1920s, during the golden era of the British Empire. While working in the party, Lyons also became a prominent Acadian oilman, founding C. H. Lyons Petroleum in 1932. \n\nHis experience in the Progressive Party and his connections with the banking world of the Mexican Gulf granted Lyons the ability to rise through the ranks of the party and eventually become chairman, winning the 1930 elections as a popular Anglophone demagogue promoting English priviliges and rights in the region. While hailed by the Anglophone upperclass of northern Acadia, the Cajuns of the south see Lyons as the personification of anglophone authority and dominance. His rule has been contested by the various Cajun and Creole movements in Acadia, while the socialists of the Labour Party have challenged the Lyons administration's hold on power strike after strike. Charlton Lyons now is between a rock and a hard place and only time can tell if he will be able to keep Acadia in check."
HEBERT_DESC:0 "Felix Eduard Hébert was born in New Orleans. As the son of a Cajun streetcar conductor and teacher, Hébert was never destined to go into politics like most career politicians in the Acadian parliament, studying at Tulane University and pursuing a career in public relations for Loyola University. However, due to his status as a Cajun and his pro-Francophone opinion, his ambitions to become a journalist were halted. Left with few choices and a hatred for the consistent discrimination against the Cajuns of Acadia, F. Eduard Hébert became a prominent member of the PAP, helping the party in reaching out to the countryside electorate and setting up a party paper written in both Louisiana French, Louisiana Creole and Cajun English. Hébert remained a popular figure in the PAP, which had been suffering from lacking a leader for a while, and entrenched his position during the party congress of 1928, becoming the chairman of the PAP. \n\nHébert remains an ardent proponent of Cajun and Creole rights, respecting the languages and dialects of Acadia and expanding the rights of the media to cover every aspect of Acadian life."

PBACANews.1.t:0 "The Golden Star Revolution"
PBACANews.1.d:0 "After the recent hit of the economic crash in the UK reaching North America, the Acadian economy was reduced to the city of New Orleans, with unemployment in the countryside reaching 50%. With economic instability and years of English dominance in politics, Acadia's National Movement under André Laurendeau seized the opportunity and called upon the Francophones of Acadia to sever ties with the British government. With support of a majority of the armed forces and their Cajun generals, Laurendeau forced the Lyons government to resign and flee to London, leaving Acadia in the hands of the national movement."
PBACANews.1.a:0 "Je suis un fils de France!"
PBACANews.1.b:0 "Shocking..."
PBACANews.2.t:0 "Loyalist Coup in Acadia"
PBACANews.2.d:0 "With the failure of the Lyons government to properly respond against the Francophone revolution tearing apart Acadia, the Acadian Commonwealth Forces of Joseph L. Collins have seized all governmental bodies and acted decisively against the revolutionaries. Anti-Cajun legislation has expanded under the new military government and many members of the National Movement have been arrested this morning. The MN's leader, André Laurendeau, has seemingly fled to Mexico, while the PAP leadership has gone into hiding during the military crackdown against Cajun organisations."
PBACANews.2.a:0 "A true display of Anglo oppression!"
PBACANews.2.b:0 "God save Acadia!"
PBACANews.2.c:0 "Okay"


PBACAEvent.1.t:0 "Export Crisis"
PBACAEvent.1.d:0 "With the fall of the British economy in London, Acadia stands before a big problem: the export-focussed economy of Acadia is reliant on the US, UK and Mexico. However, with the lowering of wages in those countries, people have started to buy cheaper local produce and energy instead of export. This has put a damper on our export, as the port of New Orleans is visited by fewer ships every single day. With less export and lowering prices, many industrialists and farmers are forced to either fire their employees or lower their wages, leading to unemployment and an increasing decline in prices. The situation has grown dire and the Lyons government has to respond quickly."
PBACAEvent.1.a:0 "Let the market do its thing!"
PBACAEvent.1.b:0 "Support the victims of this crash!"
PBACAEvent.2.t:0 "The Sugarcane Scheme"
PBACAEvent.2.d:0 "As the crop of the proud south of Acadia, sugarcane has been a major product of export for the nation for decades, rivaling the cotton industry of the north and the Cuban sugarcane industry for nearly 20 years. However, with the recent economic crisis hitting most of the civilized world, sugar demand has dropped, having become a luxury good for most in London, Berlin and Philadelphia. \n\nThe declining demand has also lead to a declining price, leading to profit plummeting. To combat this issue, Acadia's biggest sugarcane farmers have started to burn extensive amounts of the crop, hoping to artificially increase the pricing of sugarcane. These fires now burn across the south, as the proud sugarcane crop of Acadia now suffers amidst the economic crisis."
PBACAEvent.2.a:0 "We reap what we sow"
PBACAEvent.3.t:0 "The Yellow Star Protest"
PBACAEvent.3.d:0 "Today, followers of the Mouvement National gathered in front of the Acadian parliament, protesting against the Lyons government. Bearing the flag of the Cajun people, the protestors violently started to break into English shops and bars, assaulting anyone who looked English. Their leader, André Laurendeau, stood in front of the protestors, speeching about the impending liberation of Acadia and the fall of the Anglo devil, rallying the Cajun nationalists even further. Few windows survived those hours, as bricks and chairs learned to fly in the capital of New Orleans. \n\nEncircled by the Cajuns on all sides, the Lyons cabinet and those present in the parliamentary building started to panic. At any minute could the protestors force open the doors and crash into parliament, which would spell the end for Charlton Lyons and every other politician present. The army was already present near New Orleans, awaiting orders, but their effectivenes could easily be questioned, as the protest grew by the second. What could Lyons do?"
PBACAEvent.3.a:0 "Listen to the people and resign!"
PBACAEvent.3.b:0 "Give the green light to the army!"

ACD_society:0 "Diverse yet Unequal"
ACD_society_desc:0 "The State of Acadia has been an incredibly diverse region compared to most states of the United States. While the Anglo populace has most of its political power, demographically, its barely 10%. The majority of the state population is made up by the sons and daughters of the former French colonists of Louisiana, known as Acadians or Louisiana Cajuns. This group holds some political priviliges, though only those of the confusing non-Creole type of Cajun can hold any office in the state. \n\nThis brings up the question of Creole, as it formerly was used as to describe any Cajun, no matter his race, born after the failed expulsion of Acadians in Louisiana. Nowadays, however, due to the English being confused by the idea of division based on cultural identity instead of racial features, have appropiated the word into dividing European Cajuns and African Cajuns, using Creole as a term for the French African community of Acadia. \n\nThis, however, does not even explore the tip of the iceberg of Louisiana demographics, as many Welsch, Irishmen, Native Americans, Croatians, Dutch and former Haitian Frenchmen have started to call Acadia home, though having to slave under the white Anglo force."
ACD_fucking_anglos:0 "The Burden of Acadia"
ACD_fucking_anglos_desc:0 "While we may be a subject of the British Empire, Acadia shares no common history or destiny with its British lords. Our blood is tied to the fields of Normandy and the farms of Corsica: We've sought new life in the New World and have been beaten again and again by foreigners. United in only identity and language, the people of Acadiana are no different than the Irish fighters or Scottish warriors that once fought Anglo oppression. A shared hatred for Britain has fueled populist agendas and keeps the Acadian dream of independence burning like a fire, similair to the passion every Acadian feels, Creole or not, for their republican ties, as they, like the Parisian footsoldier or the Merchant from Bordeaux, are a product of the Great Enlightenment and its philosophy."
