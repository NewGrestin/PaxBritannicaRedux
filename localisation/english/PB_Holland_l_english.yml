holland.0.t:0 "The Democracy Debate"
holland.0.d:0 "The debate is upon us. Politicians and citizens shiver at the thought of its results. It will decide so much, yet seem so insignificant at the same time. At least that depends on who comes out on top.\n\nLet us enter the Estates-General and see what the future will bring to this nation and what it will mean for our dreams, values and liberties. The country is split between two clear sides with no clear majority. We have had great struggles and significant decisions before, but this time there is no Stadholder to hold our hands, no Prussian King to protect us, a British navy to defend our coastline and importantly no Thorbecke to get us through hard times or to make our decisive decisions for us.\n\nLet the debate begin."
holland.0.a:0 "Let us not stall further."
holland.2.t:0 "Vote on the Status of the Islands"
holland.2.d:0 "'Sir.' the aide began. 'As you know, the Estates-General has been debating the future of the North Sea Islands for a few days. All the votes except for yours have been collected. The count difference is razor-thin.' This isn't what he'd wanted to hear. Jacob Adriaan Kalff, the State-Pensionary, had failed to be convinced by the arguments provided by either the Free or the Regenten Provinces, but now it was up to him to decide the status of the islands.\n\nHe furrowed his brow and stared out his window. Whichever side won out would be the ones deciding the fate of the islands - able to enact any reforms in their favor. But no matter which side he picked, he'd be inviting ire from those he'd rejected. It was a question of whether the islands should become the economically-oriented provinces that the Regenten were hoping to create, or allow the new citizenry living there the freedom to elect more provincial representatives as per the wishes of the Free Provinces. Both arguments had their own drawbacks and that's what had made it so diffi - "Ahem." The aide cleared his throat, interrupting the State-Pensionary's train of thought.\n\n'Uh... Sir? What should I tell them?'"
holland.2.a:0 "'Give it to the Free Provinces.'"
holland.2.b:0 "'They'll go the Regenten Provinces.'"
holland.3.t:0 "Convening The Estates-General"
holland.3.d:0 "The Dutch parliament was at a standstill. Parliament had been reconvened multiple times since both the Election Standards Act and the Dualism Restriction Act had been passed, but all of them had ended with no progress. Politicians amongst the Republicans parties and the Regenten circles had become intensely polarised, refusing to give a single inch to the other side, fearing that it would give them an advantage. Debates were fierce and rarely were the rules of parliamentary decorum acknowledged, let alone followed.\n\nNot long into the latest parliamentary session and a new verbal clash had already broken out over a relatively minor bill that had been proposed. Voices were raised and tensions were high. 'Ladies! Gentlemen! Please quiet down! This is not the place for such squabbling!' The chairman implored to his inattentive and uncaring audience. Nobody was listening. The shouting match grew louder. 'Everyone! Please!' The chairman's cries were ignored, as they had been across all of the latest sessions. He looked down at his feet, tense with frustration, anger, and resignation.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, a loud gasp. He quickly looked up. As he'd been looking at his feet, a member of the Republicans had charged the Regenten side of the House and thrown a punch towards another member. The punch was the final straw. Fury had overcome all the members of the House, and now what was once a volatile tension had exploded into complete chaos. The chairman could do nothing but watch."
