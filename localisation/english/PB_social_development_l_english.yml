		# Social Development Worsens
			PB_social_development.10.t: "Poverty Rate Worsens"
			PB_social_development.10.d: "Across the country, destitution has become increasingly commonplace. Jobs have all but dried up in some areas, and many wander the streets looking for any work they can find. It's clear to the government that our policies have increased poverty across the country, dramatically impacting economic health and reducing standards of living. We must do what we can to try and remedy this."
			PB_social_development.10.a: "Oh no."

			PB_social_development.11.t: "Industrialization Worsens"
			PB_social_development.11.d: "In the cities, factories lie increasingly empty. Apartment blocks that once thrummed with life are now deathly quiet. More and more, our people look to the agrarian lifestyle for stability and comfort. The economy suffers as the pastoral lifestyle that so many people once lived by becomes more and more commonplace. Our industry will suffer greatly from this social shift, but our agricultural base will benefit from the change."
			PB_social_development.11.a: "We must reject modernity."

			PB_social_development.12.t: "Literacy Rate Worsens"
			PB_social_development.12.d: "Classrooms lie empty, books sit abandoned on desks, and most people across the country have abandoned the need for higher education. Rural areas languish as even adults lack the capacity for basic reading comprehension, and their children will fare little better as books are tossed aside for menial labor. This will greatly impact our country's capacity to industrialize and will lead to a gradual increase in poverty."
			PB_social_development.12.a: "Work is more important than Learning"

			PB_social_development.13.t: "Economic Health Worsens"

		# Social Development Improves
			PB_social_development.20.t: "Poverty Rate Improves"
			PB_social_development.20.d: "Thanks to our national policies, the country's overall rate of poverty has substantially decreased. Joblessness has been lessened, and standards of living have dramatically improved for the lower class. Slums have begun to gradually empty out, and the crime rate has been impacted substantially by this national shift."
			PB_social_development.20.a: "Great!"

			PB_social_development.21.t: "Industrialization Improves"
			PB_social_development.21.d: "Factories hum to life, coal is shoveled into boilers and thousands migrate to the cities to pursue new work. Industry has greatly expanded and brought with it all the benefits and curses that it can provide. As agriculture is modernized and mechanized, more and more people look to cities and towns for work, bringing with them the tools and talent needed for a hungry economy. Though this will impact our agricultural base, it will greatly increase our nation's industrial capacity."
			PB_social_development.21.a: "Modernism is the way of the future."

			PB_social_development.22.t: "Literacy Rate Improves"
			PB_social_development.22.d: "Classrooms fill with eager children across our country, ready to learn. Our policies have greatly increased literacy nationwide. Programs in poverty-stricken areas have helped many adults in rural areas go from illiterate to reading at an acceptable level. This increase in national brainpower will help to improve our industrial and economic base as more of the population can make better decisions and learn at a faster rate."
			PB_social_development.22.a: "Writing is the cornerstone of civilization"

			PB_social_development.23.t: "Economic Health Improves"
			PB_social_development.23.d: "PLACEHOLDER"
			PB_social_development.23.a: "The better the market, the freer the people!"

			PB_social_development.24.t: "Westernization Improves"
			PB_social_development.24.d: "The nation has progressed further on the path to modern, western civilization. Old tribal and gerontocratic practices are being abandoned more and more for Western-style cultural mainstays. Communities become more and more reliant on modern agricultural methods, while some move to the new industrial capitals where smog now chokes the once empty skies. Old ideas fall to the wayside as a new generation looks to Europe for the future.\n\nOur nation shifts further towards becoming a modern, industrial and most importantly Westernized state."
			PB_social_development.24.a: "Civilization, Ho!"
