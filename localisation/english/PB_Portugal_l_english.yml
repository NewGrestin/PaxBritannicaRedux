  PB_POR_chemical_menace:0 "Haunted by Chemicals"
  PB_POR_chemical_menace_desc:0 "During the Iberian campaign of Portugal, the Portuguese youth were eager to jump into the trenches for the Portuguese crown. Blissfully, the youth fought the enemy, until it happened: yellow clouds of toxin reached the Portuguese trenches killing the young boys like flies in a raincloud, dropping by the thousands after every chemical attack. Portuguese revenge for these losses came in the form of failed offensives, losing more young lives. In 1909, Portugal used mustard gas for the first time against the Spanish, but this reprisal for the shock of 1906 was not satisfying for the parents that only received the helmets of their sons. This ‘lost generation’ would become the prime target of anti-war propaganda used by the Republican Party during the Spanish civil war, as to encourage young men not to sign up for the Portuguese expeditionary force in Spain. The people of Portugal have been scarred forever and are still haunted by the yellow ghost of mustard gas."
  PB_POR_forgotten_revolution:0 "The Forgotten Revolution"
  PB_POR_forgotten_revolution_desc:0 "For some, it seemed like the Industrial revolution that expanded European power in the 18th century never reached the shores of Portugal: one of the lowest literacy rates of Europe, a lacking transportation system and almost no industry has left Portugal to be economically unstable to the core. Under Carlos I, Portugal declared bankruptcy thrice and the scramble for Africa has not been worth the extensive investments Portugal has counted on. Portugal will have to solve its economic and technological issue if it wants to remain relevant on the worldstage."
  PB_POR_liberal_menace:0 "Creeping Spectre of the Republicano"
  PB_POR_liberal_menace_desc:0 "Since the enlightenment touched upon Europe and the ideas of monarchy became old-fashioned, republicanist idealism has cursed Portugal. The growing social tension between the working class and the court has, however, not been as dangerous as some other European nations have experienced, as the Republican Party is divided to its core. We should still be carefull for revolution, as the militant enthusiasm of the republicanist are a threat to the monarchy and the catholic ideals Portugal is build upon."
  PB_POR_overstretched_empire:0 "Overstretched Empire"
  PB_POR_overstretched_empire_desc:0 "Since the loss of Brazil in the 1820s, Portugal has been an empire of nothing. The scramble of Africa, however, restored the national identity of Portugal as an exploring colonizing nation and many excited adventurers invested in the new African possessions of portugal. This new empire would last a thousand years! Reality, however, is often disappointing and the investments in Angola, Togo, Mozambique and Morocco never generated profit for Portugal. The military budget skyrocketed with these new territories and with the creation of the Suez canal, trade around the cape of Good Hope and the essential Portuguese profit from this would plummet. Today, Portugal is completely overextended with military posts across the world while its economy can not even support its military at home."
  PB_POR_revolution:0 "The Portuguese Revolution"
PB_POR_revolution_desc:0 "Portugal is lit ablaze by the fires of republicanism and the once prosperous cities of Portugal now stand as urban battlefields, housing deadly snipers and revolutionaries among the buildings build to once house innocent civilians. This conflict will remain a Portuguese conflict till the day we win."
 PB_POR_black_market_rampant:0 "Rampant Use of the Black Market"
 PB_POR_stock_crisis:0 "Lisbon Stock Crash"
 PB_POR_stock_crisis_desc:0 "The aftereffects of the British stock market disaster have reached the shores of Portugal and have grinded our already weak economy to a halt. Banks have closed their doors and many people now sit in the streets without a job, losing any faith in the government and the crown."

 portugal.1.t:0 "The Portuguese Revolution"
 portugal.1.d:0 "The tension between Republicanist and Monarchist forces have finally burst, as general Henrique Mitchell and the blue forces met with the protestors in Lisbon. The time of peace and negotiations had ended, as Mitchell told his army to open fire on the revolutionaries. At the end, 126 Portuguese republicans, consisting of women and children, died that day. The news spread like wildfire throughout Portugal and republican forces have set aside their differences, joining together in their revolution against the crown of the Braganza dynasty. News from Lisbon and Guarda have already confirmed that republican militants have taken control in the provinces, while the monarchist forces have ralied their banner in Galicia and their stronghold in Algarves. Manuel II has already expressed his shock, dissapointed in both the people of Portugal and his army for letting it get out of hand in such a short period of time."
 portugal.1.a:0 "The king is dead, Viva a República"
 portugal.1.b:0 "We will crush this rebellion"
 portugal.2.t:0 "Plundering of Churches"
 portugal.2.d:0 "Considerable news has reached the republican capital, detailing the horrific deeds done by Republican militias against a small local church. The church itself was firstly plundered of its riches, with the soldiers eventually destroying it with fire, leaving nothing but burned bricks and wood where the church once proudly stood. The news of church disloyalty in republican territory is nothing new, but this act has sparked debate inside parliament, questioning if the republicans should alienate the conservative side of Portugal through burning their churches. The Jacobin extremists have been openly hostile towards the church and seem to agree that the church had it coming. The more liberal side of the party has been rather sceptic of this approach and the faction under Machado have expressed their concern for the future of Portugal if the militias would continue their conservative witchhunt."
 portugal.2.a:0 "The Jacobin contingency clearly knows best"
 portugal.2.b:0 "Church burning is not the Republican way"
 portugal.3.t:0 "Wartime Black Market"
 portugal.3.d:0 "The black market often flourishes during difficult times, as people turn towards it when the normal market fails to deliver. However, the fact that the market is not regulated by the state means that dangerous substances often find their way to the population. Thus, the question has arisen if the government should allow the use of the black market by the militias, or if the government should step in and close it down forever, as to secure the future of the people and to keep them away from these dangerous drugs that flow through Portugal."
 portugal.3.a:0 "A little opium never hurt anybody"
 portugal.3.b:0 "Crack down upon this devilish market"
 portugal.4.t:0 "White Terror"
 portugal.4.d:0 "The considerable effort of the Republican army has finally seemed to break the monarchist spirit, as stories from Algarves and Galicia tell us the atrocities done by their soldiers. In their fear of republican sympathies, monarchist militias have started to execute suspected republicans in their territory, hanging them by the dozens. The story of 'the crucified syndicalist' also spread across republican territory, as integralists had supposedly crucified a republican supporter in their territory. If the stories are completely true does not matter in the slightest, as they have secured our position in the hearts of republicans across Portugal."
 portugal.4.a:0 "We'll drive these butchers out of Portugal!"
 portugal.5.t:0 "Red Terror"
 portugal.5.d:0 "As the blue divisions are quickly making their way towards Lisbon and other strongholds of the republicans, stories have started to circle around the military high command, detailing the acts of extremists as a last desperate defense. The most popular story is the story of the unknown soldier: A soldier caught by the liberated youth division, who was interogated for 7 long hours. The soldier stood bravely against the republican bastards and eventually was executed for his trouble. Variants of the story also detail the republicans scalping the soldier and using his organs as a foodsource, due to the low rationing of the republican militias, though these stories are not believed by many soldiers."
 portugal.5.a:0 "That will definetely validify our coming actions..."
 portugal.6.t:0 "Lisbon Trials"
 portugal.6.d:0 "The recent fall of the Republican stronghold of Lisbon has been the starting sign for the Lisbon trials, a serie of trials deciding the faith of several suspected republican leaders, mostly of the extreme jacobin branch of the party. The trails, set up by the military high command, have attracted a lot of people and many yearn for these criminals to face justice for their indescribable crimes against humanity. While evidence is lacking, many do not care and the court seems to heavily favour to see these criminals hanging."
 portugal.6.a:0 "They deserve imprisonment"
 portugal.6.b:0 "Death awaits these criminals"
 portugal.7.t:0 "Benefit from Civil War?"
 portugal.7.d:0 "The Portuguese civil war seems close to lost for the monarchists, as their troops organize for a last desperate offensive. However, while their effort was applaudable, their future lost does open up the question of the Azores, a group of important Atlantic islands that has been used by the British navy several times in recent history. A republican victory in Portugal could mean the end of British access to the Azores and could even lead to the Azores becoming a future naval base for the French, which we cannot afford. Thus, the British Royal Navy and Airforce have proposed a quick occupation of the islands. Revenge for such an action would be impossible for the Portuguese, as they are still busy with their civil war. However, many do seem to fear such occupation could hurt British-Portuguese ties, driving them into the arms of France and Spain."
 portugal.7.a:0 "Seize those islands!"
 portugal.7.b:0 "We can't lose the Portuguese as allies!"
 portugal.8.t:0 "The Crash hits Portugal"
 portugal.8.d:0 "Recent news from Britain had shocked the world, as their economy collapsed faster than a paper house, leaving behind the fallout of this crash around the world. Portugal, being the closest British ally politically and economically, is definetely affected by this economic crash and many the Lisbon stockmarket has confirmed the worst fear of our ministry: the weak, unproductive and primitive economy of Portugal is completely shattered with nothing left to repair it with. The general populace has already taken it to the streets demonstrating the new working conditions and prices, but the government can do little to help these people."
 portugal.8.a:0 "May Maria have mercy on our stocks..."
 portugal.9.t:0 "Hyperinflation runs rampant"
 portugal.9.d:0 "The recent economic crash of Portugal forced our current economic minister, José Vincente, to rework our domestic finance policies, as to protect our economy from any further hits. One of his policies regard the quick debt collection of the other imperial powers, who have given loans to Portugal and now, as their economies also are affected by the crash, want their money with high interest back. His policy of printing money to repay those debts, however, created a bigger problem: Hyperinflation. The printing of money made the Portuguese real worthless and has kicked Portugal even further down the drain financially."
 portugal.9.a:0 "Good grief..."
 portugal.10.t:0 "Day of the Revolution"
 portugal.10.d:0 "As Manuel II awoken from his slumber, a worried servant walked into the room of his majesty. Annoyed by this display of insolence, Manuel II talked down upon his loyal servant. The man waited untill Manuel was done and gave him the news. As Manuel II read the news, he slowly turned sad, than worried and than ballistic. How dare they seize this moment to start their revolution. Are we not already in a revolution! He screamed. \n\nThe news of Preto's revolution spread across the entirety of Portugal: The news of his revolutionary undertaking was met with scepticism inside the new Portuguese republic, though many were somewhat relieved, as the possibility of peace came closer. The news of the revolution inside monarchist territory was a rather mixed bag of emotions. Many inside the court and supportive of the monarchy were disgusted by this display of disloyalty, but Peto's anti-jacobin stance did succeed among many old conservatives and his idealistic view upon the future has also led to national syndicalist support among the Portuguese youth. The Blueshirts, with popular support, have already captured most government buildings and there's a real possiblity that Manuel II is in jeopardy."
 portugal.10.a:0 "The Revolution has begun..."
 portugal.11.t:0 "Manuel II flees"
 portugal.11.d:0 "Fearing the new revolution inside monarchist territory, Manuel II has hopped on a battleship going towards the Portuguese colony of Angola. The national syndicalist revolution, due to its unorganized high command consisting of both national syndicalists and highly anti-monarchist elements like anarchists, had not made clear if it supports the monarchy and, with his life in serious jeopardy, Manuel II made the choice of leaving his nation behind."
 portugal.11.a:0 "What a shame..."
 portugal.12.t:0 "Manuel II stays"
 portugal.12.d:0 "While his life may have been in jeopardy, Manuel II was determined in staying inside his Portuguese palace. The national syndicalists have now made clear contact with his majesty and have made it rather clear that the high command never had any intentions of deposing him. This guarantee has seemingly calmed the situation between monarchists and national syndicalists and Manuel II's reign will continue to grant legitimacy to the new government."
 portugal.12.a:0 "Thanks, Manuel"
 portugal.13.t:0 "The Question of a Succesor"
 portugal.13.d:0 "As Manuel II has fled the nation and had no son to become king after his reign, the national syndicalists have met with the monarchists integralists, debating about the future of the monarchy. While willing to suppport a monarchy, several members of the national syndicalists have proposed the establishment of a totalitarian state, ruled by an absolute prime minister. While this idea has sparked some interest, the integralist faction have accused these ideas as jacobin and seem to only belief in an effective monarchy under their proposed leader, Duarte Nuno, duke of Braganza."
 portugal.13.a:0 "Get Duarte here!"
 portugal.13.b:0 "A Totalitarian Regime is more fitting of our situation"
 portugal.14.t:0 "Portugal wants to join"
 portugal.14.d:0 "Our loyal friends in Lisbon have recently send a request to London regarding our alliance, the commonwealth of nations. The Portuguese seemingly seek to further cooperation between Portugal and the British Empire and have requested to join the Commonwealth of Nations, as to protect Portuguese interests in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe. Their request has mostly been approved, but some voices do regard Portugal more as a thorn in the British side, then an actual ally."
 portugal.14.a:0 "We need loyal allies"
 portugal.14.b:0 "We can do without the Portuguese"
 portugal.15.t:0 "The Commonwealth Welcomes us"
 portugal.15.d:0 "In a fitting display of true loyalty and friendship between nations, Britain has agreed upon our request of joining the commonwealth of nations. This global development will surely have an effect upon the revanchist power of France."
 portugal.15.a:0 "Portugal fights with Britain"
 portugal.16.t:0 "The Commonwealth Rejects us"
 portugal.16.d:0 "Our nation is outraged at the recent display of treason from the United Kingdom, as our friendly request of joining their alliance of independent, western states was rejected. History will show us that their mistake will benefit us eventually."
 portugal.16.a:0 "We never liked them anyway..."
 portugal.17.t:0 "Portugal seeks to join our Pact"
 portugal.17.d:0 "An envoy from the serene Atlantic nation of Portugal has brought rather favorable nations to Paris. The Portuguese, tired of Anglo hegemony, have come to us and our alliance, hoping to join us in our coming war against Anglo-Saxon dominance. Their request, while somewhat naive, could help us in the coming storm. Should we accept them?"
 portugal.17.a:0 "Oui"
 portugal.17.b:0 "The Portuguese are still too Anglo-friendly for our liking"
 portugal.18.t:0 "The Revanchiste Pacte Welcomes us"
 portugal.18.d:0 "Words from Paris have confirmed the dreams of many among the Portuguese imperialist court: France has accepted us in their little alliance against Britain and Germany. We will make an amazing asset in the coming conflict, or will make a great point of pressure in French ambitions regarding Europe, Asia and Africa."
 portugal.18.a:0 "We will rise together!"
 portugal.19.t:0 "The Revanchiste Pacte Rejects us"
 portugal.19.d:0 "News from Paris has caused major disturbance among many government officials, as our small request of joining the rising power of France in their revanchist alliance was rejected. While we now have to find another alliance for our interests, we can safely say that their rejection could easily spell their doom."
 portugal.19.a:0 "They will fall alone, right?"
 portugal.20.t:0 "Protest against Freitas"
 portugal.20.d:0 "The failure of our current minister of the treasury, José Freitas, has clearly angered the people, as a protest in Lisbon began to demand his resignation. This anti-Freitas sentiment was shared by many inside the court, including Manuel, and Freitas was forced to resign shortly after the protests, pressured by the king and the head of government. \n\nWith Freitas gone, two known men have offered to take Freitas' old position. The first man is António Salazar. Salazar, while coming from a poor family, studied law at Coimbra and is very popular among the poorer classes of Portugal for his economic moral. as a staunch proponent of balancing the budget and austerity, Salazar has some rather clever economic ideas. \n\nThe second man is Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro. Mitchell is a staunch monarchist and the current colonial governor of the pink map region. Having studied at the military academy of Lisbon, Henrique is rather nationalist in his economic policies, regarding the Portuguese industry as a child that needs to grow. His policies are rather popular among the old court and nobles of Portugal."
 portugal.20.a:0 "Henrique is the right guy!"
 portugal.20.b:0 "Salazar has a great mindset!"
 portugal.21.t:0 "February Attack"
 portugal.21.d:0 "The newspapers of Portugal are scrambling today to cover the latest news, as our majesty, Manuel II of Braganza, nearly died in a republican attack. \n\nThis morning, Manuel II attended the opening of a new street in Lisbon named in honor of his father. However, the opening quickly turned into a bloodbath, when members of the Liberated Youth attacked Manuel's bodygaurd with a small German pistol. The oldest member of the attack was just about to attack Manuel II when his gun jammed, safing Manuel II from a gruesome death at the hands of the Republican radicals. The attackers were arrested after the attack and Manuel II has escaped the attack with only light emotional damage. However, the republicans have made it rather clear that Manuel II is in grave danger when walking his own streets."
 portugal.21.a:0 "Atleast the king survived"
 portugal.22.t:0 "Preto Speeches in Army Camp"
 portugal.22.d:0 "Small rumours from a northern army camp has confirmed the suspicion of Manuel that Preto, head of the national syndicalist movement, had been around the frontlines recently. The same rumours also tell us about a supposedly amazing speech given by this Preto. Soldiers described his orating skills as marvelous and almost royal. \n\n§RIt seems increasingly clear that Preto can become an opponent of the state§!"
 portugal.22.a:0 "Who let that buffoon talk?"
 portugal.23.t:0 "National Syndicalists in the Blue Front?"
 portugal.23.d:0 "While our tactical alliance with the national syndicalists in the blue front has beared its fruits, the dangerous party is still nothing more than a junior member of the front, not being allowed in the most secret of meetings with his majesty. Their leader, Francisco Preto, has brought up this difference in partnership today and, with support of the other junior partners like the catholic extremists and integralists, has asked the king to allow the junior partners to become full members of the Blue Front. Their demands had clearly spooked the rest of the blue front members, as both the delegates of the conservative party as the military office looked in fear towards the kings delegate."
 portugal.23.a:0 "Why not?"
 portugal.23.b:0 "We'd rather not..."
 portugal.24.t:0 "Blueshirt Division"
 portugal.24.d:0 "After being allowed into the more secret meetings with the king, Preto has been rather busy in proposing changes in the tactics of the blue front. His most recent proposal involve Preto's very own blueshirts, the National Syndicalist paramilitary. He has promised unlimited blueshirt support in the war effort, in exchange for political priviliges, such as allowing the §RRevolução§! to print freely and not be restricted by royal censorship. Such priviliges seem rather acceptable, but the army does fear that Preto's proposal is just a piece of his plot in overthrowing the current government."
 portugal.24.a:0 "We do need more able bodies..."
 portugal.24.b:0 "A bunch of bullshit, if you ask me."

  POR_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Portugal§! is a secondary power in Europe in 1933.\n\nThe Empire of Portugal ended with the Brazilian war of Independence, as any relevance Portugal had was lost after losing its primary colony of Brazil. The empire went into an economic decline, quickly becoming one of the poorest countries in Europe. During the Great War, Portugal was scared to get entangled into the web of conflict stretched across Europe. However, British pressure and the threat of Spanish dominance forced Portugal into the Great War, becoming the main front of the §YIberian campaign§! that claimed so many innocent, young lives in the grinding machine of war. \n\nPortuguese troops were able to break the Spanish front in 1908, eventually leading to Spain capitulating on the 7th of may, 1910, sparking §Ythe Spanish Civil War§! with the Portguese troops stuck in the middle of it. Portuguese troops had to quickly redeploy to Galicia and the Portuguese-Spanish border, but not before several more young men were taken in front of our very own eyes. \n\nThe end of the Great War would see Portugal returning to its economic instability and colonial ventures, holding onto our relationship with Britain. However, Manuel II had started to create political enemies, such as §YThe Portuguese Republican Party§! and its paramilitary wing §YThe Liberated Youth§!: While enjoying popular support, the Republican Party itself is divided to its core ideologically, based upon a jacobin-liberal split. Only if Portugal would actively be in an international or national crisis, would the Republican party have a chance of challenging Manuel's reign. Still, Portugal's political landscape has been marked with the blood of politicians and monarchs for decades. What could stop that from happening under Manuel II? \n\nThe §YKingdom of Portugal§! is a §Ysecondary power§!"

 PB_POR_civil_war_mechanic:0 "Portuguese Civil War"
PB_POR_civil_war_mechanic_desc:0 "Jacobin and Liberal treachery has finally reached a point of no return. King Manuel II and his court have to quickly find a way to manage this rebellion against the crown if they want to secure the future of Portugal and its colonies. Blue militias have already made their way to fight for Manuel II and much of the Portuguese clergy have already blessed our majesty in this conflict. \n\n §YCurrent Support for MNS: [ni.GetPartySupport]§!"
PB_POR_unite_portugal:0 "Blue Front Unification"
PB_POR_unite_portugal_desc:0 "The Blue Front is the term used to describe the anti-republican forces fighting in the Portuguese civil war. While this term describes an united force, this force is far from united in reality: National syndicalists, integralists, military officers, loyalists to the crown and conservatists all fight a common enemy, but without a common goal."
#PB_POR_loss_of_the_civil_war:0 "National Syndicalist Plot"
#PB_POR_loss_of_the_civil_war_desc:0 "While we may work with the national syndicalist elements in our blue front, they're not to be considered friends of the regime. While #having a base of moderate monarchists, they do not belief in the future of the monarchy. If this civil conflict would last too long, they could easily amass popular support #from both the far right and far left in overthrowing the monarchist government. We either have to force these elements out of our government or we should try to win this #conflict as quickly as possible."

SPR_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The defeat of Spain at the hands of the American/Commonwealth troops in 1910 led to the creation of the Spanish Republic, deposing the former bourbon king in favour of a republican system dominated by the left-wing for its first years. During this political back and forth between the socialists and the conservatives of the republic, radicals were able to seize the opportunity in 1932, launching the Mary Coup and ending the republic. Spain now stands on the path of civil conflict and can possibly fall apart once more. How shall the army lead Spain into the next decade, with bloodshed or understanding?"
