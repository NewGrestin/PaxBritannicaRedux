 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by landships have multiplied, from enemy landships, anti-landship guns, dedicated landship destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own landships alive in the face of these threats."
 engine_tech_1:0 "Basic Engine"
 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Where the landships of the Great War were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern landship relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."
 engine_tech_2:0 "Improved Engine"
 engine_tech_2_desc:0 "With bigger guns and heavier armor, the new generation of landships requires a more powerful engine to remain mobile."
 engine_tech_3:0 "Advanced Engine"
 engine_tech_3_desc:0 "Mechanized warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our landships are to carry modern weapons and enough armor to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."
 engine_tech_4:0 "Modern Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc:0 "The numerous new additions to landships made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."

 squeezebore_adaptor:0 "Squeeze-bore Adaptor"
 squeezebore_adaptor_desc:0 "A special adaptor at the end of the gun lowers the diameter of the barrel and squeezes a shell down to a smaller caliber. This significantly increases muzzle velocity and thereby the penetration power of the gun. It does require special ammunition made from rare materials."
