 NI_VARIANT_01:0 "§ONew Imperialists§!"
 NI_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§ONeo-Imperialism§! is less of a unified ideology and more a set of similar principles shared by different groups. While 19th Century Imperialism was born out of the mission to civilize and a need for resources, New Imperialism was born out of the cultural chaos of the Great War's aftermath.\n\nUnlike a conventional dictatorial system, Neo-Imperialism advocates for the grand expansion of the state to dominate their neighbors both culturally, economically and politically. The concept of cultural dominance is particularly prevalent, as Neo-Imperialists believe in the inherent superiority of their home culture, and often see other cultures as inferior. This often extends to the topic of race, with Neo-Imperialists advocating for obliteration of so-called savage cultures and identities. Though there are naturally variances, Neo-Imperialists are almost invariably violent expansionists with aims on their neighbors and the world at large."

 NI_VARIANT_02:0 "§OUltranationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OUltranationalism§! is a form of extreme nationalism focusing on the importance of one state or racial group above all others. Unlike Neo-Imperialism, Ultranationalism is not couched in Victorian concepts of racial superiority. Instead, it focuses on a xenophobic distrust of other races, seeking to eliminate them alltogether rather than forcefully assimilate them. Many ultranationalists hold a mythologized view of their national history, drawing on ancient or even mythical origin stories to build an extremist mythology around their people."

 NI_VARIANT_03:0 "§ONational Syndicalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§ONational Syndicalism§! is a form of left-wing extreme nationalism intended to fuse the nationalist struggle and class struggle. Under National Syndicalism, Trade Unions are often a key aspect of the integral national struggle. It disregards concepts like democratization or reformism in favour of reactionary political policies combined with mildly progressive social policies. In many cases, the means of production are concentrated in the hands of the state, rather than the proletariat."

 NI_VARIANT_04:0 "§OClerical Ultranationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§OClerical Ultranationalism§! is, as the name implies, a synthesis of religious dogma and ultranationalist reactionary doctrine. The church, or alternate religious equivalent, holds major value as an organ of the nationalist state. Dogma is a principle motivating factor in government decisions, but not the sole factor as typical nationalist ideology still holds considerable sway."

 NI_VARIANT_05:0 "§ORevolutionary Nationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§ORevolutionary Nationalism§! is a combination of Revolutionary Republicanist ideas and ultranationalist doctrine. Birthed during the tumultous interwar years of the French Republic, Revolutionary Nationalism was first described by French thinker Georges Sorel. He argued for taking the revolutionary republicanist aspect of Jacobinism and combining it with a strong, militaristic reactionary state. In recent years, the ideology has been pushed by French Armandists, their titular idealogue being former Jacobin Inessa Armand. "

 NI_VARIANT_06:0 "§ONeo-Colonialism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§ONeo-Colonialism§! refers to a particularly ultranationalist variant of imperial colonialism. Rather than merely lording over the colonized groups, Neo-Colonialist regimes seek to actively impose their culture and hierarchy on these foreign groups.\n\nAs an ideology, Neo-Colonialism is a relatively recent invention. The political radicalization of countries like France have created new strains of imperial ideological thought, including Neo-Colonialism. The ideology has primarily gained traction in the Green Sahara colonies, where Europeanization is still maintained in full."

 NI_VARIANT_07:0 "§OUltramilitarism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_07_desc:0 "§OUltramilitarism§! as a concept refers to ultranationalist states organized primarily around the armed forces and an intense focus on aggressive expansionism. Distinguishing these states from a conventional military dictatorship is the absolute primacy of the military in all aspects of live and an intense focus on expansion at all costs. Extreme patriotism is commonplace, as is a complete disregard for expending human lives in the name of conquest. Ultramitarist regimes are dangerous not just for their rampant totalitarianism, but for their practical capacity to enforce their aims on the world."

 NI_VARIANT_08:0 "§OPrussonationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_08_desc:0 "§OPrussonationalism§! emerged as a concept out of the First National Awakening of the 1920s, which tore through Eastern Europe and nearly unraveled the Russian Empire. Prior to the 1920s, Prussia had existed as a divided state, split between Brandenburg-Prussia and Russian Prussia. It was due to this that a newly independent Prussia had no real national identity to speak of, split between the interests of aristocrats and the ethnic minorities that composed much of the nation’s hinterlands. Poles, Lithuanians, Baltic Germans, and a sizable Russian minority all had diluted the previously German dominated region.\n\nThe ideology of Prussonationalism emerged as an effort to reconcile the Germanic Nationalist ideology with the reality of their divided nation. Rejecting the Pan-German ideology of their forebears, the new Prussonationalist state seeks to reunify with their Western brethren and escape the shadow of their former Russian overlords."

 DS_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§ODespotism§! is a blanket ideology often ascribed to dictatorships, absolute monarchies and other right-wing authoritarian states. Though they can vary wildly in domestic and foreign policy, despotic regimes will always do everything in their power to crush domestic threats to their power.\n\nThese regimes are often extremely militaristic, focusing on a mixture of reactionary values and propaganda to encourage an almost fanatically loyal population, or, at the very least, a population unwilling to openly challenge their dictates."

Technocrats believe that democratic ideals are intrinsically against effective management of the government, and believe almost religiously in a form of scientific meritocracy."

 DS_VARIANT_06:0 "§OAuthoritarian Democracy§!"
 DS_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§OAuthoritarian Democracy§! is a system of government where democracy is conducted by the ruling elite of an authoritarian state in an effort to represent the varying interests of a society.

 DS_VARIANT_07_desc:0 "§OBolivarian Democracy§! is a unique system of government established under the Bolivarian Empire following the accession of Simon Bolivar as Emperor. Best described as a mix of German Constitutionalism and hegemonic democracy, Bolivarian Democracy is an enigmatic ideology often subject to the interpretations of its' adherents.\n\nDespite being undeniably authoritarian, Bolivarian Democracy has seen a wide variety of variation in policy. Populism has remained a key component of the ideology, being seen as the primary means by which the government maintains the support of Colombia's population."

In many cases, however, dominant party democracies tend to be defined by corruption and intimidation tactics to maintain control."

 DS_VARIANT_09:0 "§OOrthodox Cosmism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_09_desc:0 "Russian Cosmism emerged in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, building off the modernization efforts of Alexander II. It proposed a vision of human existence that combined elements of science, spirituality, and the exploration of outer space.\n\nCentral to Russian Cosmism is the belief in the unlimited potential of human beings and the pursuit of immortality. Cosmists envisioned a future where humans could overcome the limitations of the physical body and achieve eternal life through scientific and technological advancements. Russian Cosmism draws inspiration from diverse sources, including Russian Orthodox Christianity, Western philosophy, and scientific theories of the time. It sought to reconcile scientific progress with spiritual and metaphysical concepts, seeing the exploration of the cosmos as a means to achieve higher states of existence.\n\nThe influence of the Russian Orthodoxy would prove critical in the popularity of the movement. The Fyodorovite branch of the Church would grow in prominence during Russia's modernization, cultivated by many who wanted to see the Church become a force for progress. This has culminated in much of the Russian Orthodox church being dominated by the Fyodorovites, who advocate for a radical restructuring of Russian society around faith and transhumanist science."

 DS_VARIANT_10:0 "§ORasputinite Orthodoxy§!"
 DS_VARIANT_10_desc:0 "Rasputin’s cult of personality had long been a source of problems for Russian authorities in Siberia, yet despite their attempts at suppression he remained strangely popular. Some attributed this to his strange charisma, which helped garner him a surprisingly large group of followers who attended his services and indulged his eccentricities. During the Great War, Rasputin used the influx of Russian troops throughout Siberia as an opportunity to preach and expand his influence. He frequently held mass pre-battle baptisms for troops on their way to the meatgrinder fronts of the Amur and Korea.\n\nAfter the war, Rasputin’s sway over the peasantry of Siberia had grown deeply entrenched. He used the growing technologic development of Russia to his full advantage, growing his flock through radio and Kinegram broadcasts. All of this fell beneath the notice of St. Petersburg, largely due to local officials falling under the sway of the Rasputinite cult, either out of genuine faith or a willingness to take their generous contributions.\n\nBy 1933, the aging Mad Monk had fully wormed his faithful into the organs of the Siberian state and lived in immense luxury off the back of his followers. He maintained an enormous harem of female followers, funded local religious militias, and had most of the local government officials in his pocket. Rasputin’s particular brand of Orthodoxy emphasizes himself as the sole speaker of the faith and his importance as the spiritual guide for the Russian peasantry."

Though not always overtly authoritarian, reactionary political parties will attempt to acquire and maintain power through authoritarian means. The ideology group is not particularly unified, however, and there are significant variances between different reactionary factions.\n\nReactionary groups can vary from simply militaristic conservatives to religious fundamentalists and monarchist cliques, but they share the unifying ideal of rolling back reforms in favor of tradition and dogma. They desire a return to the old days of their nation, and are extremely hostile towards anything that might prevent their restoration of these traditions."

 RC_VARIANT_02:0 "§OReligious Fundamentalism§!"
 RC_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OReligious Fundamentalism§! is an ideology rooted in extreme devotion to clerical doctrine. Vehemently reactionary in regards to social change, religious fundamentalists court their supporters through a fanatical obsession with their particular sect.

 RC_VARIANT_05:0 "§OSocial Credit§!"
 RC_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§OSocial Credit§! advocates for a financial system that places emphasis on the creation and distribution of credit. It contends that the current monetary system, based on debt and interest, creates economic imbalances and inequality. Instead, it proposes a system where the government, rather than banks, has the authority to create and control the money supply to ensure that it serves the needs of the people.\n\nCentral to the party's ideology is the belief in social and economic justice. It promotes the idea of "social credit," which suggests that all citizens should have access to a basic income or dividend to ensure a decent standard of living and address poverty. The party seeks to address economic disparities by distributing the wealth generated through productive activities more equitably."

Progressive Conservatism has been a major driving force behind historic reformist movements, most notably the British push to abolish slavery.\n\nIn many cases, Progressive Conservatives push social reforms and economic policies that would traditionally be seen as left wing or liberal, while maintaining some regressive cultural norms. In some cases, this might manifest as a means to undermine socialist support through competitive welfare policies that pull votes from left wing candidates.

The term itself emerged out of the Guangdong region of China where the merchant class was dominant, infusing money into foreign exchange programs and education. Much of this was born not out of love of Europeanism, but rather out of a desire for a stronger liberalized and most importantly unified China.\n\nGuangdong Liberals have often advocated for a federalist model of governance for China, arguing that the vast nature of the nation makes the more unitary model of the Taiping unsustainable. Conversely, they have rejected the philosophy of the Northern Anarchists, who they argue are far too decentralized.

 SS_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§OState Socialism§!, often called Bismarckian Socialism, is an ideology of moderate Socialists emulating the welfare policies of Bismarckian Germany. Though the term was used by Bismarck's enemies to mock his policies, many began to use it as a general term for policies similar to those he implemented. State Socialists are sometimes revolutionary socialists, but are not quite as extreme as Jacobins. Many advocate for democratic socialist ideas, such as the creation of welfare states and encouragement of worker's rights. Others are more extreme, such as Bukuninists that push for more Anarcho-Collectivist ideas.\n\nRegardless of specifics, with the continuing march of industrialization, State Socialists will always find their support in the factories and unions of many nations."

 SS_VARIANT_02:0 "§OBakuninist Collectivism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OBakuninist Collectivism§! was developed largely as a reaction to the rise of Jacobinism. Developed by Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin, Collectivism rejected the idea of a revolutionary vanguard proposed my most Jacobin theorists. Instead, Bakunin proposed the idea of an nearly stateless society, operating via direct democracy. In the wake of the bloody postwar Jacobin revolutions, many disenchanted socialists embraced Bakuninist Collectivism and its' ideals of revolutionary democracy and worker's self management."

 SS_VARIANT_03:0 "§OReformist Socialism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§OReformist Socialism§! differs from other forms of state socialism by its explicit denial of revolution as a meaningful way towards socialism. Instead, it proposes that socialism can only be brought to the masses by the ballot. Through the democratic process, how much it may favour capitalists, reform can be born and change can be made."

 SS_VARIANT_04:0 "§OAgrarian Socialism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§OAgrarian Socialism§! is a strain of socialism that seeks to combine the socialist goal of seizing the means of production with the rural way of life. Agrarian socialism explicitly rejects the urban and progressive dominance of most socialist movements and instead opts for agrarian lifestyles, including a more localized and traditionalist response to socialism. In general, the agrarian socialist movement prefers a bottom up approach to socialism, instead of the top down state-interventionism of most socialist movements."

 SS_VARIANT_05:0 "§OKautskyism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "Karl Kautsky was a prominent Czech political theorist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He played a significant role in shaping the ideology of social democracy and was a leading figure within the pre and post unification German Empire.\n\nKautsky emphasized the importance of the working class as the agent of social change and the need for class solidarity. He advocated for the improvement of working conditions, the protection of workers' rights, and the establishment of social welfare measures to address socioeconomic inequalities within capitalist societies.\n\nKautsky's ideas influenced the nascent German socialist movements, who had been primarily influenced by the concept of Bismarckian Socialism. Ironically, while Bismarck himself was anti-socialist, his policies intended to disenfranchize socialist parties helped birth the electoral platforms those parties would eventually embrace."

 SS_VARIANT_06:0 "§OPan-Arab Socialism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "Central to Pan-Arabism is the belief in a common Arab identity that transcends national boundaries. It seeks to foster a sense of Arab nationalism and promote cooperation and collaboration among Arab nations. Pan-Arabists argue for the creation of a unified Arab state or a confederation of Arab countries to protect Arab interests and promote Arab unity on political, social, and cultural levels.\n\nSocialist Pan-Arabism is an ideology that combines the principles of Pan-Arabism with socialist ideals, advocating for the unity of Arab nations and the implementation of socialist economic and social policies. While socialist Pan-Arabism shares common objectives with other socialist ideologies, it specifically focuses on the Arab region and the unique challenges faced by Arab societies. It seeks to combine the principles of socialism and Arab unity to create a more equitable, democratic, and prosperous Arab world."

They call for an end to foreign domination and the equitable distribution of resources and wealth within African societies.\n\nSocialist Pan-Africanism also aligns itself with anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist struggles. It critiques foreign exploitation and economic dependency, advocating for self-determination, sovereignty, and the protection of African resources and interests.\n\nWhile socialist Pan-Africanism shares common principles with other socialist ideologies, it specifically focuses on the African context and the unique challenges faced by African nations. It seeks to combine the principles of socialism and Pan-African unity to create a more equitable, prosperous, and self-reliant Africa."

In many cases, however, dominant party democracies tend to be defined by corruption and intimidation tactics to maintain control."

 SS_VARIANT_09:0 "§OLabour Socialism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_09_desc:0 "§OLabour Socialism§! is a variation of socialism focused, naturally, on labour movements. Born out of the poor working conditions of the late 19th century, the labour movement became a pervasive force across the developed world, further accelerated by the Second Renaissance in the late 1800s. As millions migrated from the countryside into vast steel cities and megaplexes, they found the dream of the working man often trod upon by powerful megacorporations. In response to this, many large union groups were formed to fight for fairer conditions.\n\nLabour socialism found its roots in these movements, and in contemporary times is one of the more common forms of popular socialist ideology, concerning itself more with practicalities over a slavish devotion to theory."

 SS_VARIANT_10:0 "§OLabour Zionism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_10_desc:0 "Labor Zionism is an ideology that combines the principles of Zionism with socialist ideals, with a particular emphasis on the role of the working class in the establishment of a Jewish homeland.\n\nCentral to Labor Zionism is the belief in social justice, equality, and workers' rights. Labor Zionists advocate for socialist economic policies, including cooperative ownership of land and industries, and the establishment of communal agricultural settlements known as kibbutzim. They prioritize collective labor, egalitarian distribution of resources, and the development of a society that promotes the well-being of all its members. Labor Zionism also places importance on building a Jewish society rooted in democratic values, where civil liberties, cultural expression, and social welfare are upheld. It seeks to foster a sense of community, solidarity, and mutual responsibility among Jews."

The Narodniks seek to address the social and economic issues faced by the peasantry and advocate for radical social change.\n\nThe Narodniks believe in the importance of the rural peasantry, or the narod, as the driving force behind social transformation. They aim to mobilize the peasants and rural workers to challenge the existing power structures and establish a more egalitarian and just society.\n\nOne of the key ideas of the Narodniks is "going to the people", which involves intellectuals and activists living among the peasantry to understand their needs and aspirations better. By doing so, they aim to awaken class consciousness among the peasantry and organize them for collective action."

 JC_VARIANT_01:0 "Jacobinism"
 JC_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "Jacobinism is a school of thought that originated in the French Reformation. Originally espoused by Robespierre, modern Jacobins argue for the abolition of all hierachy, not just monarchy. Their principle concern is the creation of a direct democacy, often alongside the creation of a revolutionary vanguard to protect said democracy. In reality, however, this often leads to a far-left authoritarian government. Though progressive socially, Jacobin states are often despotic and militaristic, seeking to spread their revolution abroad.\n\nJacobins foster their support in the poor and defenseless, seeking to galvanize them to overturn the many crowns that pepper the Earth, bringing revolution worldwide."

 JC_VARIANT_02:0 "§ORevolutionary Anarchism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§ORevolutionary Anarchism§!, sometimes colloquially referred to as Bakuninism, is a splinter ideology of Jacobin thought. Though the idea of decentralized states predates even the concept of ideology, modern revolutionary anarchism finds its roots in the works of Mikhail Bakunin, Nikolai Tchaikovsky and Henry David Thoreau.\n\nAs with many left wing ideologies, the most basic principles of anarchism vary wildly depending on who you ask. The most dominant school of thought in contemporary times lies with Russian revolutionary Nikolai Tchaikovsky, who advocated for armed resistance to the Tsarist autocracy until his arrest and death in 1906. With a martyr to rally their cause around, the Tchaikovsky Circle would become one of the most notorious terror networks in the Russian Empire.\n\nOutside of Russia, cosmopolitan anarchism remains a niche ideology, while so-called frontier anarchism found success in the North American interior. With the west remaining largely ungoverned, instances of frontier anarchism have sprouted up organically across the region. Most notably, New Walden would arise out of this ideological melting pot, basing their beliefs on Thoreau's eco-anarchism or green anarchism."

 JC_VARIANT_03:0 "§ORevolutionary Imperialism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§ORevolutionary Imperialism§! is a radical, militant offshoot of Jacobinism arguing for the continued spread of the people's revolution. Revoultionary Imperialists seek to expand into surrounding nations and beyond, creating sister republics dedicated to their liberators' revolutionary ideals. Even among other Jacobins, Revolutionary Imperialists are seen as dangerous radicals, not just for their militancy but their tendency to gain traction within revolutionary militaries."

 JC_VARIANT_04:0 "§ONational Jacobinism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§ONational Jacobinism§! is the term given to the rightist branch of Jacobin thought. Originating out of Germany, National Jacobinism grew as a rejection of French Classical Jacobinism, which was a distinctly liberal ideology. National Jacobins, instead, appeal to the militaristic and more socially conservative members of society. While still arguing for revolutionary republicanism, National Jacobins are against social reformism and believe in the importance of maintaining societal norms. In this way, National Jacobins are socially reactionary but economically collectivist. In many ways, the militant conservative nature of National Jacobins is more comparable to Neo Imperialist thought than Classical or even Reformist Jacobinist thought."
 
 JC_VARIANT_05:0 "§OClassical Jacobinism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§OClassical Jacobinism§! is an offshoot of traditional Jacobin thought that rejects the vanguardism and political tutelage of more conventional Jacobinism. Classical Jacobinism advocates for the idea of \"Revolutionary Democracy\", under which the majority of power is decentralized among the population and executive power is kept controlled via checks and balances. Though denounced by conventional Jacobins for the rejection of the vanguard, Classical Jacobins remain a prominent offshoot of Revolutionary Republican thought."

 JC_VARIANT_06:0 "§OKingoro Hashimoto Thought§!"
 JC_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§OKingoro Hashimoto Thought§! is a branch of Revolutionary Republican thought unique to the Japanese Republic. Coined by dictatorial leader Kingoro Hashimoto, Hashimoto Thought combines elements of Japanese martial values with left wing populism and revolutionary republican ideas.\n\nOriginally conceived as a means to justify his seizure of power, Hashimoto has crafted his ideology into something uniquely Japanese. Simultaneously nationalist and internationalist, decrying monarchy yet defending dictatorship, Kingoro-Hashimoto Thought is very much a product of its' environment."

 JC_VARIANT_07:0 "§OSocial Banditry§!"
 JC_VARIANT_07_desc:0 "§OSocial Banditry§! imitates the beliefs of Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give to the poor. However, this ideology requires the state to effectively always be hostile with all of its neighbours. Conducting raids, robbing banks, and any other avenue of gaining wealth to fund the state.\n\nThere is no real government to speak of and the state completely relies on its army, in the form of gangs to administer the nation in any capacity."

 JC_VARIANT_08:0 "§OTranscendental Naturalism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_08_desc:0 "§OTranscendental Naturalism§! is an ideology built out of the teachings of Henry David Thoreau, a prominent naturalist and proponent of civil disobedience. Thoreau believed in the inherent goodness of individuals and their ability to lead meaningful lives by following their own conscience and intuition. He advocated for a simplified and deliberate existence, emphasizing the importance of personal freedom and autonomy. Much of this remained simply theory until the Dissolution of the Mexican Empire, which saw the emergence of numerous Trekker settler states.\n\nThe untamed wilderness of North America would be the ultimate testbed of Thoreau's ideas, culminating in the formation of the Transcendentalist state of New Walden. The modern incarnation of Transcendentalism is staunchly individualist and decentralized, focusing on the primacy of ruralism and the common man. While ideologically adjacent to Jacobinism, Transcendentalists do not consider themselves to be revolutionary republicans and merely aim for similar goals."

 JC_VARIANT_09:0 "§OButlerism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_09_desc:0 "Smedley Butler’s march to the West coast has birthed an ideology built out of revolutionary republicanism and desperation. Butlerism is principally pragmatic, making whatever decision is necessary to maintain the continuity of the state. It is similarly militaristic, as Butler’s forces frequently clashed with local groups on the path to their current position.\n\nUltimately while the current head of the Continental Army is a revolutionary at heart, his movement is ill defined and will require time and development to reach whatever state Butler and his people choose to create."

 JC_VARIANT_10:0 "§OStratocratic Butlerism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_10_desc:0 "Smedley Butler is a military man, first and foremost, and thus his ideology has grown to reflect that identity. The enemies of the revolution have been sought out, uprooted, and purged from the New America with fire and steel. The Second American Revolution has achieved its’ final goal and fully expelled the Anglo-American traitors from the East and brought about a future for the next generation. This future will, of course, be defined by the dictatorship of Smedley Butler.\n\nRefusing to give up his emergency powers, Butler rules America as a revolutionary autocrat. The military and securocratic elements of the nation rule with impunity. There will be nothing beyond the control of the nation’s new Jacobin warlord. Whatever illusions the pre-war congress had of maintaining power have been dashed as Butler staffs it with his own lackeys to maintain control.\n\nThe Second American Revolution has reached its’ natural conclusion as a militant, red-tinted autocracy."

 JC_VARIANT_11:0 "§ORevolutionary Americanism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_11_desc:0 "Butler’s efforts to bring revolution to the Americas have succeeded, and once again the United States are on the map. With Butler acceding to the Revolutionary Congress, America experiences something vaguely resembling the democracy once hoped for in 1776. The new United States formed under the Congress shifts away from the autocracy of Butler’s emergency powers, hoping to form a more equitable union in the mold of the first revolutionaries.\n\nThough not fully democratic, the new ideology formed by this state is a sort of Americanized Jacobinism, taking the ideas of republican revolution and putting an American face on them. This has proven popular among the populations conquered by the United States, although it will take time for the ideology to fully take root.\n\nStill, in spite of all the chaos and hardship of the Reclamation War, the Second American Revolution has reached its’ natural conclusion as a true revolutionary democracy."
