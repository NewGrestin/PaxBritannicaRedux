The world was torn asunder by the very technology that had once uplifted it, millions died meaningless deaths, ground up by the machinery they'd built to better their world. The ouroboros of empire forever consuming itself amidst the ashes of a better future that would never arive.\n\nOut of the ashes came a generation of nihilists, disenchanted with the glossy future promised by Tesla and Edison. The future needed to be taken back, clutched in the bloodied hands of the people it was stolen from. The doctrine of Neo-Imperialism, through never codified as a coherent ideology, became violent expansionist revanchism. The most prominent version of this, naturally, rose from the destruction of the Bourbon Empire and the Latin Bloc. Various subdivisions exist, differentiating between specifics, but amongst all there remains the guiding principle that the gods of steel and light were false ones.\n\nOnly though a great §rbloodletting§! can the true future be born."

Unlike Neo-Imperialism, Ultranationalism is not couched in Victorian concepts of racial superiority.

Prior to the 1920s, Prussia had existed as a divided state, split between Brandenburg-Prussia and Russian Prussia. It was due to this that a newly independent Prussia had no real national identity to speak of, split between the interests of aristocrats and the ethnic minorities that composed much of the nation’s hinterlands. Poles, Lithuanians, Baltic Germans, and a sizable Russian minority all had diluted the previously German dominated region.\n\nThe ideology of Prussonationalism emerged as an effort to reconcile the Germanic Nationalist ideology with the reality of their divided nation. Rejecting the Pan-German ideology of their forebears, the new Prussonationalist state seeks to reunify with their Western brethren and escape the shadow of their former Russian overlords."

This ideology is characterized by a fervent and often fanatical devotion to one's nation or ethnic group, coupled with a belief in the supernatural or mystical aspects of their national identity. Ultranationalists believe in the superiority and purity of their nation or ethnic group above all others. They often advocate for the preservation and expansion of their culture, often through exclusionary and xenophobic means.\n\nUltranationalist mystics often use symbols, rituals, and ceremonies with deep historical or mystical significance to reinforce their beliefs. These rituals can include elaborate flag ceremonies, worship of ancestral figures, or the use of sacred texts and artifacts. What sets Ultranationalist mysticism apart is its infusion of mystical or spiritual elements into nationalism. Followers may believe in supernatural connections to their nation's past, including claims of divine intervention or mystical ancestry."

In particular, Techno-Supremacists argued that the Second Renaissance highlighted the failures of conventional modes of human governance. It was only after the Great War that Techno-Supremacism took on a revolutionary bent, with adherents believing that humanity’s propensity for war had created a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe only way to defuse this hypothetical bomb being a radical restructuring of society, elevating those willing to shed their humanity to higher positions of authority over the weak-willed fleshlings."

Cosmists envisioned a future where humans could overcome the limitations of the physical body and achieve eternal life through scientific and technological advancements. Russian Cosmism draws inspiration from diverse sources, including Russian Orthodox Christianity, Western philosophy, and scientific theories of the time. It sought to reconcile scientific progress with spiritual and metaphysical concepts, seeing the exploration of the cosmos as a means to achieve higher states of existence.\n\nThe influence of the Russian Orthodoxy would prove critical in the popularity of the movement. The Fyodorovite branch of the Church would grow in prominence during Russia's modernization, cultivated by many who wanted to see the Church become a force for progress.

Some attributed this to his strange charisma, which helped garner him a surprisingly large group of followers who attended his services and indulged his eccentricities. During the Great War, Rasputin used the influx of Russian troops throughout Siberia as an opportunity to preach and expand his influence. He frequently held mass pre-battle baptisms for troops on their way to the meatgrinder fronts of the Amur and Korea.\n\nAfter the war, Rasputin’s sway over the peasantry of Siberia had grown deeply entrenched. He used the growing technologic development of Russia to his full advantage, growing his flock through radio and Kinegram broadcasts. All of this fell beneath the notice of St. Petersburg, largely due to local officials falling under the sway of the Rasputinite cult, either out of genuine faith or a willingness to take their generous contributions.\n\nBy 1933, the aging Mad Monk had fully wormed his faithful into the organs of the Siberian state and lived in immense luxury off the back of his followers. He maintained an enormous harem of female followers, funded local religious militias, and had most of the local government officials in his pocket.

Unlike conventional despotism, this ideology focuses primarily on reinstating the rights and rules of the aristocratic systems that once dominated European politics rather than a conventional civilian or military dictatorship.\n\nTo some extent, democracy may even survive in this system, though likely with restrictions on who can vote and how. Often times landowners are the only voting class or the general population's votes count for less than those of the ruling class.

The constant demand for war industry to fuel the Ottoman-Egyptian Wars throughout the 1800s and early 1900s created a sizable minority of augmented military officials within the Empire. These groups of highly trained augmented soldiers began developing cliques within the military, and a notable few developed the concept that they were the modern reincarnation of the Janissary Corps, albeit gilded in metal rather than cloth.\n\nThese new §OTechno-Janissaries§! eventually grew to eclipse the influence of the Ottoman military and even the Sultan himself. In 1929, the Great Levantine War ended with a stalemate. The Ottomans had pushed deep into Egyptian-held territory but had failed to land a final killing blow on their perennial enemy. Sensing weakness, the Techno-Janissaries seized their chance and toppled the civilian government, installing a techno-supremacist military dictatorship.\n\nThough perhaps not quite as extreme as the name might imply, the Ottoman Janissary dictatorship is nonetheless a repressive one. The failings of the Empire, they argue, come from a failure to embrace the developments of the Second Renaissance fully. In their eyes, if the Empire is to survive the coming century, its’ foundations must be built on steel, not stone. Augmentation, gene-splicing, all of these and more must be brought in at all costs to ensure a future where the Sublime Porte once again rules the Islamic world."

Born out of the poor working conditions of the late 19th century, the labour movement became a pervasive force across the developed world, further accelerated by the Second Renaissance in the late 1800s. As millions migrated from the countryside into vast steel cities and megaplexes, they found the dream of the working man often trod upon by powerful megacorporations. In response to this, many large union groups were formed to fight for fairer conditions.\n\nLabour socialism found its roots in these movements, and in contemporary times is one of the more common forms of popular socialist ideology, concerning itself more with practicalities over a slavish devotion to theory."

Society exists for the purpose of conserving his rights and perfecting his being, and everywhere society degrades and oppresses him! The time has come to remind him of his true destiny.”§!\n-§OMaximilien Robespierre§!\n\n§OJacobinism§!, often referred to as Revolutionary Republicanism, is an ideology birthed from the European Constitutionalist Revolutions of the mid-late 1700s. The guiding principle of the ideology is the concept of egalitarianism, the firm belief that all men are created equally and that power must rest in the hands of said people. The ultimate end-goal of this doctrine is the “World Republic”, a meritocratic egalitarian state spanning all four corners of the globe.\n\nAs an ideology, Jacobinism is delineated into various schools of thought. The primary school is built on the ideas of Maximilien Robespierre, a French lawyer and political theorist who was imprisoned during the French Reformation for advocating the abolition of the Bourbon monarchy. Robespierre’s papers, known as the Twenty-Two Theses, formed the bedrock of the Jacobin Political Club that developed around him. Robespierre was eventually released, but his consistent attempts at revolutionary agitation earned him an exile from France.\n\nOver time, Jacobin political theory evolved alongside the shifting demands of the people. The World Republic Committee was formed in the late 1800s, creating the first semi-unified doctrine for the Revolutionary Republican movement. In contemporary times, Jacobins are an extremist movement, kept securely contained by the old monarchies in Europe. Outside the continent, Jacobinism finds new lease among the oppressed peoples of the world. The Jacobins offer their adherents one immutable promise:\n\nOne day, the old and famous states of the world will shudder, and their crowns will fall beneath a tide of liberty."

 JC_VARIANT_02:0 "§ORevolutionary Anarchism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§ORevolutionary Anarchism§!, sometimes colloquially referred to as Bakuninism, is a splinter ideology of Jacobin thought. Though the idea of decentralized states predates even the concept of ideology, modern revolutionary anarchism finds its roots in the works of Mikhail Bakunin, Nikolai Tchaikovsky and Henry David Thoreau.\n\nAs with many left wing ideologies, the most basic principles of anarchism vary wildly depending on who you ask. The most dominant school of thought in contemporary times lies with Russian revolutionary Nikolai Tchaikovsky, who advocated for armed resistance to the Tsarist autocracy until his arrest and death in 1906. With a martyr to rally their cause around, the Tchaikovsky Circle would become one of the most notorious terror networks in the Russian Empire.\n\nOutside of Russia, cosmopolitan anarchism remains a niche ideology, while so-called frontier anarchism found success in the North American interior. With the west remaining largely ungoverned, instances of frontier anarchism have sprouted up organically across the region. Most notably, New Walden would arise out of this ideological melting pot, basing their beliefs on Thoreau's eco-anarchism or green anarchism."

National Jacobins, instead, appeal to the militaristic and more socially conservative members of society. While still arguing for revolutionary republicanism, National Jacobins are against social reformism and believe in the importance of maintaining societal norms. In this way, National Jacobins are socially reactionary but economically collectivist. In many ways, the militant conservative nature of National Jacobins is more comparable to Neo Imperialist thought than Classical or even Reformist Jacobinist thought."

While such phenomenon might appear as a contemporary byproduct of a broader regain of interest toward irrationalism and the occult, its first occurrences can be traced back to the Reformation Era. \n\nAmidst the multitude of radical movements and political initiatives flourishing throughout Europe at this time, some would embrace ritualistic practices — with highly codified ceremonies, an emphasis put on secrecy and various considerations about faith, the human soul and metaphysics. Rooted either in Kabbalism, esoteric Christianity or theistic beliefs, these fellowships would eventually fall dormants as revolutionary enthusiasm vanished off. \n\nWhat could have been considered as an ephemeral and ultimately futile oddity eventually resurfaced in the late-nineteenth century. As capitalism sweeped mercilessly the old faiths to impose its mercantile rationality, a new dissenting esotericism arose to oppose both the old Order of the autocrats and the new techno-industrial hegemony. Diving into Eastern philosophy while drawing from romanticism and decadentism, Revolutionary Mysticism would slowly grow in importance over the course of the twentieth century — gaining enormous appeal as the Great War brought about mass delusion toward the sciences which allowed such bloodshed to occur. \n\nAs diverse as the hundreds of sects acting in its name, Revolutionary Mysticism  nonetheless holds true the tenet of the revolution not being a purely materialistic affair. Only through spiritual and collective renewal shall the individual reach the Nirvana of its emancipation."

She has long been an outspoken proponent of free elections and women's suffrage, being a key player in the movement to establish a fully democratic government. However her opponents regularly accuse her of trying to reclaim the birthright she was robbed of so long ago, when the rumours of her illegitimacy led to the position of Stadhouder to be abolished. If either of these rumours are true is yet to be seen. The left wing of the CDU are called the§! §RMusteites§!§g. Formerly the Protestant People’s Party, who make up the CDU’s left wing.

Back in 1790 they managed to secure their rule over the Republic by overthrowing the then Stadhouder §!§OWillem V§!§g. They quickly become popular with the populace, and with support from France successfully partitions the Austrian Netherlands between the two powers. However their power is short lasting, as in 1808, the Stadhouder returns with the Prussian army and gets rid of the Patriotten who flee to France. There were a few attempts by the Patriotten to retake control once more of the Republic, but both attempts in 1815 and 1823 were unsuccessful. After the appointment of Thorbecke by the Stadhouder, in 1853, the Patriotten split into three factions. A radical, a moderate and a liberal wing. The moderates called themselves §!§9the Middenlijners§!§g (Middle Liners), the radicals \n§!§RThe Rode Kameraden§!§g (Red Comrades) and the liberals the §7Zwolle Kliek§!

Though they had their obvious troubles with each other, the three sides cooperated. However when the §!§1Guild Coup§!§g occurred in 1891 and the Patriotten had to go into hiding, troubles between the three camps flared up again.
