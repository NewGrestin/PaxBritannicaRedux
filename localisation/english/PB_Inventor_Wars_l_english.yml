  inventorwar.1.t:0 "The Child of Light"
  inventorwar.1.d:0 "The Edison Imperial Electric Exposition was a place not known for tact or subtlety.\n\nEnormous plasticine lightbulbs flanked each side of a vast stage, while showgirls twirled about beneath the flickering bulbs of the press corps. Scandelously clad waitresses toured through the crowd, handing out cocktails and cigars to the backing of a booming live jazz band. Amidst it all, at center stage, stood arguably one of the most powerful men on Earth.\n\nCharles Edison flashed the crowd a smile, piping cigar in hand as an aide handed him a microphone, and for just the briefest moment it seemed the whole world stopped for him alone. The band eased down, the crowd went quiet, a single light shown down on the stage.\n\n\"Now folks, I gotta tell ya, was that not the most fantastic show on telescreen?\"\n\nA pause for the applause, naturally.\n\n\"See though, the glitz and the glam, that's not what this company is really about. It's about building a better future, today. We are, in the year of our lord nineteen thirty three, on the verge of things thought impossible a hundred years ago. We've banished want across the entire Sahara Green Belt, we've bridged the world with the telescreen, but it's important to never lose sight of the most important thing, and that's changing lives.\"\n\nEdison, letting his smile drop for a moment, glanced over the crowd. He had them on the line, and now all he needed was to reel em' in.\n\n\"I've brought on a very special guest to speak with all of you tonight, and I hope her words will affect you as much as they've affected me. She's one of the greatest success stories of the modern era, a woman dealt one of the worst hands you've ever seen, but she's perservered, and thanks to this company's advancements in hearing and sight implants, she'll be able to live a life far beyond the deal god gave her. I'd like to invite to the stage Miss Helen Keller!\"\n\nFrom the backstage emerged an aged woman, dressed simply and waving to the gathered press. Edison surrendered the stage, handing off the mic to Keller and standing back to watch his best advertisement sell augments like hotcakes. Just to be safe, though, he made sure the cameras got a good view of the ocular implants. He needed to get his money's worth out of that tech, lord knows the R&D costs alone nearly bankrupted a few departments. Could you really put a price on curing blindness, though?"
  inventorwar.1.a:0 "Especially when it'll make so much damned money?"

  inventorwar.2.t:0 "The Child of Darkness"
  inventorwar.2.d:0 "If you were to look at Teslagrad, you might think it little more than a moldering industrial park, increasingly buried in the dust of the Central Asian Uplands. The unassuming ruins, one might think, were just the leftovers of an oil refinery or perhaps a military outpost. One would be forgiven for not knowing that at one point, this was a place where wonders were born.\n\nNikola Tesla, the man who created the modern world, was pulling up cabbages. The scruffy, shuffling elderly man hardly resembled the man who had ushered in the Second Renaissance. All the virulence had seemingly been struck out of him and like a shivering automaton, he pulled up cabbages and quietly tossed them in a basket. All around him stood monoliths, vast research labs packed with equipment that had cost billions, and all of it left to dry rot in the Kazakh sun. The crumbling buildings seemed to watch him, silently judging him with cracked glass window eyes, and the wind carried the whispers of his own self hatred. There was hardly a second that went by where he had peace and his mind wasn't flooded with terrible thoughts, screams, cries. Every day he stared at the noose he'd put up in his office and every day he called himself a coward when he couldn't kick the chair.\n\nFrom a makeshift dinner table, Tesla took in a bowl of cold cabbage soup and a glass of milk. He did this same routine each afternoon, each day, for the last decade. Cabbage and milk was the only thing he could bring himself to eat anymore, anything else, anything the Tsar's men had brought him, he couldn't touch. Immaculately produced cakes and caviar, all left to rot in a fridge somewhere because all he saw in it was blood, intestines and scorched skin. He was a prisoner, just as much to his mind as to Moscow, even if now he was little more than some fetid curiosity to be discussed in the tabloids. His genius had been both his creator and his damnation, and now the Empire kept him captive in a velvet cage for fear he'd sell his secrets to the world.\n\nIn the end though, he had no secrets left to give, no new genius to impart. All he was now was an old man, surrounded by cabbages and pigeons and the hulking ruins of his mistakes."
  inventorwar.2.a:0 "And at least this way, he'd never hurt anyone again."

  inventorwar.3.t:0 "Wake Up Call"
  inventorwar.3.d:0 "The letter had sat, untouched, on his desk for nearly a week. Tesla would walk past it in the morning, regarding it with quiet dread, before proceeding with his daily breakfast of soup and milk. Soup and milk, each day every day, and every time he thought he might just work up the courage to read the letter. The pink hued paper mocked him; it was Lilya’s favorite color. It was unquestionably from her. A letter hadn’t come from his wife in nearly two years. His stomach turned over, twisting in all manner of knots and binds thinking of what it might say.\n\nEventually, a morning came where the knots became too much to bear. He snatched it from the desk and tore it open like an animal; his hands trembled, as if the handwritten note were made of tungsten. He could feel his regrets, his failures creeping along his spine. The note was simple, the pen having been pressed hard into the paper.\n\n“Mother died yesterday. Should you decide to not be the coward I know you are, the funeral will be next week.\n\nBelow is enclosed the address.\n\n- Zofia”\n\nThe note fell to the dusty floor, followed shortly by Tesla himself.\n\nThe man who built the modern century laid, curled like a child, in an empty laboratory.\n\nSuddenly, a shot of pain went through him. His breath caught in his lungs as he tried to drag himself up to the desk. His arms were lead, locked up in agony as he fumbled around like a drunk. His hand wormed its way into the desk drawer and returned with a syringe; he ripped the cover off and slammed it into his neck. Tesla crumpled back to the floor, staring out the door of his lab into the moldering remains of Teslagrad.\n\nA woman was standing outside, clad in the brightest white dress he’d ever seen. One hand held a parasol, and the other a watch. Her face was obscured by an enormous summer hat; the same kind Lilya would wear in the garden back home.\n\nHe blinked and she was gone, not even shoe prints in the dust.\n\nAn hour later Tesla slowly clambered to his feet, drenched in sweat and head pounding. One wayward glance at the letter on the floor and he knew now what he had to do. In a moment, he tossed the rest of the nitro in his jacket and went for the door. He had the energy of a man possessed now, and there was only one way to make things right.\n\nHe was headed for St. Petersburg."
  inventorwar.3.a:0 "No time to waste."

  inventorwar.4.t:0 "Siberian Sunset"
  inventorwar.4.d:0 "Russia had changed, that much was evident from the train ride. He could have taken a luxury car, he had the rubles to afford one, but Tesla couldn’t enjoy that kind of pampering anymore.\n\nOf course, an Okhrana agent was on the train with him. He’d gotten used to the tails years ago. At least now they were getting paid to do something besides watch a depressive shut-in repeat the same routine for years.\n\nSlowly, the Kazakh countryside gave way to Siberian farmland. Old family farms interspersed with vast company agrocomplexes that stretched off for kilometers; the stench of modified cattle wafted through the cabin. Steel grain towers, as high as metropole buildings, loomed like obelisks. A few were emblazoned with a familiar name: “TESLA ELECTRICWORKS”.\n\nTesla shuddered and tried to relax in his seat; sleep didn’t come easy anymore. After an hour, he finally drifted off and the train was replaced with an extravagant sitting room. The fuzzy memory of a decade ago enveloped him. It was a quiet evening or, rather, as quiet an evening as one could get at the Winter Palace. Protestors shifted about outside the gates, shouting slogans and waving signs, their faces indistinct against the city.\n\nThe Tsar stood by the window and scoffed, turning to Tesla and shaking his head.\n\n“These people,” he said. “They think they know how to rule themselves, but look at how much chaos they’ve caused?”\n\nTesla didn’t respond, merely sitting with his head cupped in one hand and a newspaper in the other. It was the bulletin from Minsk; over a hundred dead. Russian Shock Troopers opening up on a crowd of protestors. Teslaworks weapons, of course, he could tell the make and model just from the blurry photographs. Alexander kept on, animated in his movements and frustrations.\n\n“But no, these Poles, these little Russians, these balts; they reject what we’ve built for them. They’d rather burn it all down than-“\n\n“Your majesty,” Tesla croaked, setting the paper on a nearby table. “I feel I have blood on my hands.”\n\nAlexander paused, glancing over the inventor as if taking stock. He scoffed, reached into his breast pocket and tossed Tesla a handkerchief.\n\n“Would you like to wipe them?”\n\nThe mocking tone of the Tsar echoed in his mind as he awoke."
  inventorwar.4.a:0 "No more sleep until the capital, then."

  inventorwar.5.t:0 "A Death in the Family"
  inventorwar.5.d:0 "Zofia’s mother was dead.\n\nShe’d known it was coming, prepared for it, steeled herself, thinking maybe it would soften the blow. It didn’t. She sat by the bedside, face buried in her hands and practically screamed in grief. Zofia reached out and snatched up her mother’s hand and clung to it like a life preserver. If she just held on long enough, maybe the warmth would come back, maybe her mother would rise and hold her, even just one more time.\n\nIt never happened.\n\nThe body remained inert; warmth slowly draining. Lilya’s jaw hung slightly ajar, her eyes glassy, like a wax simulacrum of an elderly woman. The blood settled and the warmth fled, and Zofia was left clutching a hand that now felt alien to her. This was no longer Lilya; it was merely an object that could once have been called her mother. From behind, a small hand tugged at Zofia’s coat.\n\n“Is grandma alright?”\n\nHer guts were heavy, twisting and folding on one another. With a single shaking hand, she pulled her son in close. A moment passed and the two were interrupted by a doctor.\n\n“Miss Tesla, if it’s alright I have a few papers I need you to sign.”\n\nZofia wiped her eyes and rose from the chair, taking the pen and paper and scribbling away at whatever legal nonsense the clinic needed to report a death. Midway through, she paused and glanced at the young man.\n\n“You wouldn’t happen to have an extra envelope, would you?”\n\n“Of course,” the doctor nodded. “Was there someone you’d like us to notify?”\n\nThe grief gave way to hate, and she practically spit in rage as she spoke."
  inventorwar.5.a:0 "“My father.”"
