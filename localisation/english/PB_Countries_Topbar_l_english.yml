  ENG_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe United Kingdom§! is the dominant world power in 1933.\n\n A victor in the Great War, Britain retreated into isolationism with the postwar §Y"Long Depression"§! that gripped the global economy. Propping itself up with inter-empire trade, the United Kingdom and her §YImperial Confederation§! have weathered the storm of the interwar relatively unscathed. However, vast speculation bubbles, unstable currency and growing global discontent threaten to undermine Britain's Empire, particularly as tensions continue to rise with the up-and-coming §YAmerican Commonwealth§!.\n\n The United Kingdom now faces threats from a resurgent France and Russia, eager to settle the score from the Great War, as well as conflict within their increasingly precarious Empire and the nation itself.\n\n The United Kingdom is a §YGreat Power§!.\n\n"
  JAP_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Republic of Japan§! is a growing power in East Asia in 1933. \n\n Japan was one of the few nations of Asia to survive the wave of colonialist expansion relatively unmolested. Following a period of intense isolationism, Japan began to open up to Western trade in the mid 1800s with the arrival of French and Dutch trade delegations. Fearing that a failure to modernize might see their nation subjected to the same fate as Imperial China, Japan adopted a series of radical reforms under Emperor Meiji. This period, known as the §YMeiji Restoration§!, saw Japan dramatically modernize and even contest the power of the once unassailable Chinese Empire. \n\n The rising sun, however, fell just as quickly as it ascended. The §YFar Eastern Crisis§! of 1905 saw the outbreak of war between Japan and Russia over influence in Korea and Manchuria. The initially local conflict soon became the spark that lit the powderkeg of the §YGreat War§!. Japan found itself quickly outclassed by the introduction of the British and German navies, leading to a two year long blockade and the ultimate collapse of Japanese operations in continental Asia. Ultimately, Emperor Meiji would see the very empire he helped create collapse in 1909 with the §YTokyo Garrison Rebellion§!. \n\n Spurred by riots over rationing and austerity measures, elements of the Imperial Japanese Army rebelled against the government after orders to break up the protests. Unwilling to murder their compatriots, the IJA turned on their commanders and fired the first shots of §Ythe Japanese Civil War§!. In the ensuing chaos, a provisional democratic government ascended to power alongside the growing Jacobin movement. The conflict saw the burning of the Imperial Palace, armistice with the §YImperial Powers§!, and ultimately the seizure of power by the radical Jacobins of the provisional government. In the ensuing years, Jacobin leadership lead a bloody §YRepublican Terror§!, executing or imprisoning thousands of citizens for supposed imperial sympathies. §YKingoro Hashimoto§! would ascend to power after the overthrow of the Diet in 1911, notable for his defection to the provisional government after the Tokyo Rebellion. Suspending elections with emergency powers, Hashimoto rules Japan as the so-called protector of the revolution. With resurgent Russian expansionism and China on the verge of collapse, Japan now stands poised to lead the people's revolution across Asia and beyond."
  CHI_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Empire of China§! is an empire in decline in 1933\n\nOfficially the Empire of Great Qing, the Manchu-led Chinese state has been in almost constant decline since the first arrival of Europeans. Following the §YManchu Conquest of China§!, the Qing stood as a dominant power in Asia, however decades of mismanagement and isolationism crippled their ability to project power. This would be further exacerbated with the arrival of British interests in the region and, more importantly, the §YOpium Trade§!.\n\nOpium became a major problem throughout the Empire and soon the Qing were forced to act. They began seizing and destroying Opium shipments, a decision that would set them down the path towards the §YFirst Opium War§!. Decisively defeated, the Qing were left humiliated and forced into a series of unequal treaties, effectively carving whole swathes of China into §YSPheres of Influence§!. Peking was unable to catch a break with the rise of Japan as a superpower, and would ultimately lose influence over Korea following a brief conflict. Broken, both militarily and financially, the Qing retreated into a state of isolationism, only able to issue a quiet protest when Manchuria became a battleground during the §YGreat War§!\n\nThe §YInterwar§! years have not been kind to the moribund imperial state. The streets of the Dali and Guangzhou burn with the fires of young revolution, while in the West, the Khans and Uyghurs plot their independence. The greatest threat has come with the rise of the §YNational Revolutionary Alliance§!, a broad underground coalition of nationalists, jacobins and reformists bent on overthrowing the monarchy. Even the allegiance of the military has come into question, as local governors have carved out their provinces into regionalist warlord states just itching to break free. Banditry runs amok, people are starving, the coffers are empty. The Qing Empire is on life support, and it's just a matter of time before the plug is pulled."
  AME_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - Expand Across North America\n    - Duel with the British for the fate of the Empire \n    - Defeat the Southern Insurrectionist Remnants\n    - Overtake Britain as the dominant empire\n\n§YThe United Commonwealth of America§! is the dominant power in North America in 1933, the seat of the Edison Electric monopoly, and the true muscle of the British Empire. Established in 1817 following a constitutional convention, the Commonwealth is a federal parliamentary monarchy and shares their sovereign with the rest of the Imperial Confederation. The Commonwealth is the largest constituent nation of the British Empire, and maintains the largest standing professional army and a navy overshadowed only by Britain itself. More importantly, the country is the home of the Edison Imperial Electric Company, where nearly 10% of all jobs fall under some form of EIEC jurisdiction.\n\nAmerica would prove critically important during the Great War, providing substantial troops for the invasion of Iberian Campaign. For the first time, Commonwealth troops fought under their own flag, and delivered multiple key victories. There was hardly a front where Americans didn't participate, even including a token Anglo-American force that accompanied the German siege of Paris. American military, technical and financial assistance became the backbone of the Imperial Powers, a fact not quickly forgotten in Philadelphia.\n\nThroughout the Interwar period, America would continue to assert itself within the Empire. The British find themselves as Greeks in this nascent American Empire and that resentment has greatly cooled relations. The balancing act of the Imperial Confederation is becoming more difficult by the day to maintain, threatening to split the empire in two.\n\nThe §YThe United Commonwealth of America§! is a §RGreat Power§!\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"
  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - Lead the Russian Empire through the Second Great War\n    - Combat the Secessionists in Eastern Europe\n    - Expand Russian Influence in China\n    - Battle against the League and Pan-Asian Front\n\nThe §YRussian Empire§! emerged from the Second Renaissance as the preeminent continental power in Europe. Spanning from the Baltic to the Pacific, the Tsar now commands an empire that can truly rival the German and British hegemon. During the Great War, Russia fought against the Japanese Empire across Siberia in a grueling, bitter fight over the Amur region. Though ultimately successful in pushing the Japanese off the Asian mainland, Russia suffered catastrophic losses both physically and diplomatically, the latter coming from their illegal occupation of Manchuria.\n\nWith the Treaty of Tours, Russia gained comparatively little, leading to a sense of betrayal by the rest of the alliance. Russia would ultimately withdraw from the Imperial Powers; their position later calcified when Germany pushed to recognize the independent states of the First National Awakening. The Awakening was a watershed moment for the Russian Empire, as the numerous minorities of their Western frontier rose to demand their freedom. St. Petersburg responded by annihilating the partisans in force, but not without losses on the home front as domestic dissent grew.\n\nThe modernizing efforts of Tsar Alexander II lead to the birth of a Russian middle class who demanded among other things peace and democracy. These calls were answered with the abdication of Alexander III and the passing of the crown to Tsar Michael II, who embraced the push for democracy. However, Russia continues into the 20th century there remain forces who seek to return to the old ways or to forge a new violent irredentist path.\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"
