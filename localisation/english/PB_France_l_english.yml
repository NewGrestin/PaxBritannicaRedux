  PB_Jacques_Doriot_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 26/9/1898\n\n§YJacques Doriot§! is something of an enigma in French politics. Born to a working class family in Saint Denis, near Paris. At an early age, Doriot was exposed to the revolutionary politics of wartime France. Far too young to join the military at the onset of the Great War, Doriot could only watch from the sidelines as France began to shudder and break under the strain of war. As supplies dwindled daily and the sounds of gunfire approached Paris, Doriots family fled to Orléans, where they would remain until the end of the conflict.\n\nThe collapse of the French Empire and the imposition of a Republic would catapult the nation into a period of intense unrest. Revolutionaries, restorationists and common thugs battled in the streets over what was left of the French corpse. It was in this pressure cooker political scene that Doriot would begin his rise to power. Initially a member of the Socialist Youth League, he abandoned left wing politics after the failed September Paris Uprising in 1926. Instead, he aligned himself with the newly formed French Popular Front and Marcel Déat, and by 1928 the FPF had taken the reigns of the Republic in a coalition with the pro-monarchist Action Française. Déat died suddenly in 1929 and the subsequent power struggle ended with Doriot seizing control of the party, though at the cost of major concessions to the AF and the Left-Nationalists. Now the de-facto dictator of France, Jacques Doriot seeks revenge against the Germans and the re-establishment of Frances dominance in Europe. The French population, radicalized by Long Depression and the Treaty of Tours, stand united, at least on paper, with the Grand Marshals vision of a new imperial France.\n\n§RAcross the border lies the enemy of the French people, and it is the holy duty of the Grand Marshal to exorcise this degenerate Judeo-Germanic curse from Europe, no matter the cost!§!"

  PB_Charles_Muarras_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 20/4/1868\n\n§YCharles Maurras§! is considered by some as Frances most loyal patriot, and by others as a crooked old fool that believes in bygone traditions. Whatever the case may be one thing for sure is Maurras and his cronies remain adamant on the return of the Bourbon dynasty, which has remained in exile in Corsica since the Great War. Before the Great War Maurras was a self-employed author mainly writing non-fiction books on political science, taking inspiration from various pre-20th century philosophies, namely Existentialism and Phenomenology.\n\nMaurras lived a rather poor life finding only minor success in a few written texts but by the end of the Great War this difficulty only became worse. Food stalls became a permanent fixture of Maurras' life until a small pro-monarchist printing agency hired him. From there Maurras rose through the ranks and established himself as a fairly notable writer, ultimately becoming head of the New Kings League newspaper company.\n\nBy 1927 the political landscape of France was by all definitions an utter shit show. Strikes and protests occurred almost daily and from this point on Maurras started to present himself as the man with all the solutions, gathering public support and finding a 'comfortable' position in the newly founded Front Populaire Français. Today Charles Maurras stands victorious in the triumvirate and though stability is finally restored, to some degree, reconstruction and preperation for Europes 'darkest years' is required if France is to outlive the storm.\n\n§RAll heil Maurras!§!"

  PB_Inessa_Armand_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 8/5/1874\n\n§YInessa Armand§! can only be described as both revolutionary and counter-revolutionary. She developed Armandism - a form of social nationalism - by borrowing elements from different political extremes and combining them into one heterogenous belief. Armand gained much renown and support between middle-lower class individuals during the unruly years of 1926-1928, participating in numerous strikes and boycotts. While not exactly Jacobin Armand does contain a certain distrust of those on top, hence her clique being the weakest of the triumvirate.\n\nPrior and during the Great War Armand served as an auxiliary nurse, seeing first hand the effects and brutalities of conflict unlike the other triumvirate members. Even when the war was over peace had not fallen upon France. The years following, especially those before 1929, were ravaged with social and political strife; something that worked greatly in favour for Armand. By the time the Front Populaire Français was established Inessa Armand was already a well known name amongst the French people. With her political rivals now dead, Armand can now fully realize her perfect France.\n\n§RGod bless our Jeanne, and our liberated France!§!"

  PB_Joseph_Darnand_DESC:0 "What else can be said about the man of every rumour? Joseph Darnand, chief of the SP and a personal friend of Maurras and Doriot, is a man of short stature and big sin, keen to abuse his position of power when it fits. If rumours are to be believed, Darnand currently resides in a house previously owned by an old Jewish family who he got deported on charges of thievery. The man didn't even have the wit to wait for at least a month before he made the empty house his home, pouring fire on the rumours that this wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nBeyond his exploitation of power, Darnand is supposedly part of mystic groups, engaging in various forms of Celtic, old Christian and even Roman paganism. At least, that is what you would hear from the café worker or the train instructor. Tales from goat guts to tell the future to actual human sacrifice are pinned on Darnand, though its hard to say what is real or what is not at this point. It has always been popular to depict enemies as pagans, crazy or weird, so the precise details will never be known.\n\nWhat isn't a rumour is Darnands iron grip on the SP. Despite being chief of the militia and sharing his power with a few others, Darnand has birthed a cult of personality around himself in the organisation, with a few battalions declaring loyalty to him and not the state. While the SP is far from his personal fiefdom, even after the coup, it still remains a powerful tool which Darnand may use to further exploit France and its people. One can only wonder how many houses will be empty and how many families will be deported before Darnand is truly satisfied."

  PB_Xavier_Vallat_DESC:0 "Once a devout catholic and a loyal monarchist, Vallat hasn't called himself those things in years. Mutilated by the Great War, Vallat was there to bear witness to things no man should have ever seen. An especially gruelling memory of a friend devoured by livewire during a German trench run remains haunting to the old veteran, to the point that few conversations on the war don't end with Vallat reflecting on his helplessness back then. With the horrors of war turning Vallat away from Christianity and the monarchy, he quickly became a member of the National Front and the SP militia. Rubbing shoulders with Doriot while keeping Darnand at a comfortable distance, Vallat was able to become secretary of the militia, responsible for the more administrative side of murder and disappearances, keeping the SP out of the mock judiciary of the old dictatorship.\n\nNow, Vallat has found himself standing before the golden throne of France. With little to stand for without the old party beyond his rabid antisemitism, Vallat has turned himself into the man keeping the SP together, keeping it from total anarchy and pointless violence. Instead, Vallat functions as Frances Machiavelli, forming an economy of violence by abusing the connections in the militia and the government, keeping them on a short and tight leash. For now, the SP will function as Vallats tool for national stabilisation, yet it remains to be seen if he can keep this situation running.\n\nHow long until violence implodes in on itself?"

  PB_Gabrielle_Chanel_DESC:0 ""

  PB_Jean_DESC:0 "Jean I, of the powerful Orleans branch of the Bourbon family, represents the old order that once reigned over Europe. A royal house that could have claimed the mantle of the continent, if it was not for the devastation brought upon it during the Great War. After the affair, the house was confined to the Italian peninsula, ruling over an impoverished people, while the French and Spanish branches of the house were exiled. Jean can still remember how we and his elderly father sought refuge in Corsica, escaping a France on the brink of civil conflict.\n\nToday, however, the mistakes of the post-war treaties have been undone, as Jean I stands rightfully as the sovereign of France. Yielding his sceptre, the images of a Bourbon world empire are starting to bubble up again among the public, both in France and outside of the empire, causing mixed reactions. How much trust can be placed in this absolute monarch, the father of which was, according to the Treaty of Tours, was the aggressor of the bloodiest war in human history?\n\nWhile the people may only see Jean as an absolute monarch, the truth is far different. Jean should have known that a man like Maurras, his hunger for power devouring him to the bone, wouldn't just install an absolute monarch and back out of politics. Instead, Maurras installed Jean I with extreme limits to the decisions he can make without the approval of his most loyal advisers, including Maurras. Maurras still pulls the strings, but without the potential for total public humiliation like the fallen Doriot. Instead, any blame will be pinned on the Bourbons again, as the Bourbons are far too easy to blame. Maurras has his puppet and Jean I, confined to his palaces, is unable to stop the charade."

  PB_Leader_Charles_Nogues_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 13/8/1876\n\n§YCharles Noguès§! was born into wealth. He was raised in a family owned estate in north-east Morocco for much of his childhood. Every week a new shipment of eager French colonists would arrive through the Spanish city of Melilla, here Mr. Noguès saw the rapid Francization of Africa along with all the new technologies the mainland could offer. Some called it civilization, others called it imperialism. Ironically by his late teens Mr. Noguès would take the very route many followed just to arrive to the place he called home for so long, he would establish himself in Paris and join the École Polytechnique and pursue military doctrinal studies before his entry into the army.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out Mr. Noguès specialized in armoured warfare and was an early proponent of landship utilization, spearheading Frances first Armoured Corp at the battle of Verdun; the results were simply to good to ignore. Even when the Treaty of Tours was signed secret efforts were being made to reverse engineer captured mechs, although the technology had be used against its creators general production knowledge was still unknown. "

  PB_Leader_Claire_Chennault_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 6/9/1893\n\n§YClaire Chennault§!, nicknamed Old Leatherface, is an Franco-American by birth. Originating from Louisana he took an early interest in politics, subsequently joining the Commonwealth army at the age of 18. Being far too young to apply for Operation Overlord during the Great War he instead watched from the sidelines as brothers and fathers quickly applied for the so-called 'war to end all wars'.\n\nHe finally saw reputable service in Wallonia where he was stationed on the border with France, belonging to a joint Anglo-American expeditionary force. Around the late 20s the economic situation of Wallonia was looking quite depressing and with Britain refusing troops passage back to America because of the situation with France many Americans defected across the border. Only to be welcomed by an authoritarian government in need of experienced and disciplined soliders. In fact thousands of American defectors quickly found positions in law enforcement because of their non-French identity, the state believed that these foreigners would be more harsh then the typical French man and would lack any restraint in their duties. Either by god’s good will or some anarchic chance of luck Chennault finds himself leading a nation of that he wasn't even born in but never the less Chennault will give France his all just as she gave him a new life full of opportunity."

  #PB_Maurice_Gamelin_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 20/9/1872\n\n§YMaurice Gamelin§! is France's greatest tactician. Being born in a rural town just outside of central Paris exposed Mr. Gamelin to a mixed life of odd-urban jobs and the occasional summer wheat field retreat, though times have changed. The France he once saw burn has risen once again, ready to toy with her weak prey and establish herself as Europe's greatest empire.\n\nWhen the German's came knocking on Paris' door Petain and his hastly cobbled defence force did little in preventing the fall of the French capital; Gamelin and the rest of the officer corp as a result retreated to Tours with a small contingency force being sent to Orleans. Here his skills truly shined, even though France had entered her dying hour enough time had passed for Gamelin to be promoted to lieutenant. The small operational force he operated under (which amounted to nothing greater than 4000 men) captured a vital supply line that cost the Germans and British a great deal in their campaigns, managing to hold out under continous siege till the wars end. As France enters a new age Gamelin, and many others just like him, must help France pave her way to greatest; else she shall once again fall."

  #PB_Louis_Franchet_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 25/5/1856\n\n§YLouis Franchet§! has seen the world change drastically, traditions have been replaced with steel and the rules of war have altered beyond recognition. There are few that remember a time before war, even fewer that can fixate on a society that hadn't caved to machine. As the days go by Franchet becomes one of the many few that were born prior to Europe's great industrial awakening, time has slipped from his fingers and what he has left he has dedicated to building France anew. In a great tragedy he has seen man go from conquer to conquered and if one was to ask why he held such a disliking for mans greatest creations, he simply points to all the dead that roam flanders fields. For him he remains silent about his past, it matters little wether a grand story could be told of his life. If he had made one realisation, it would be tomorrow holds all the keys to mans success, or its destruction."

  #PB_Hubert_Lyautey_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 17/11/1854\n\n§YHubert Lyautey§! is known as the 'French Empire Builder', serving as colonial administrator for French Algiers for the entirety of the 1890s has equiped Mr. Lyautey with all the tools necessary to be an effective general, and territorial overseer. He has put down numerous rebellions, namely the 1881 Indian-French uprising that nearly ended French control in India (now modern day British Madurai). With an established service record there is no doubts wether or not Mr. Lyautey will remain in French high society, he has also remained neutral in Military-SP affairs which is by far the smartest move he could possibly make. Though he may be a hot head at times Mr. Lyautey is a competent and loyal general with grand ambitions for both his name and France."

  #PB_Charles_de_Gaulle_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 22/11/1890\n\n§YCharles de Gaulle§! was born for war. His father often encouraged discussion into French history and politics during dinner, here Charles become fascinated by French society and the ever changing political climate of the world. He took a keen interest in military strategy and by the age of 19 he joined the École militaire complex as a cadet officer. For the next few years Charles would establish himself as an educated and disciplined officer, and when war came calling on the homefront Charles offered his services to France in any way he saw fit.\n\nHaving seen the horrors of the Great War, and all the new inventions man had created to kill one another Charles had grown wary of a resurgent France. Though it has become ever so clear that France is once again on the war path, as a result Charles has placed his faith in the Popular Front party and now dedicates his time studying military theories both old and new. He may not be France's finest hero, but he is certainly capable of greatness."

  #PB_Theophile_Brebant_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 24/5/1889\n\n§YTheophile Brebant§! witnessed Paris fall to the German and British hordes. The two week siege left Mr. Brebant terribly shellshocked, endless barrages of earth and metal does unspeakable things to a man and Mr. Brabant wasn't spared the worst of it. He grew a certain dislike of his invaders on a level other men never reach; constructing terrifying stereotypical recreations of the British and German man. Here he would tunnel his emotions towards these imaginative barbarians, it is therefore no surprise that when the SP promoted these very constructions Mr. Brabant quickly fell under their banner.\n\nWhile his outspoken support for the SP could one day cost him his head there are other issues Mr. Brabant must attend to, namely a faulty liver that he must repeatedly seek medical support for. Everyday his medical condition is worsened and his operational capacity is weakened, it seems France's greatest decade may be an unfinished paragraph in Mr. Brabant's story."

  French.1.t:0 "Victory in Frankfurt"
  French.1.d:0 "With the German menace finally pushed back to its capital, French forces were able to swiftly capture the administrative capital of the German Empire. With the fall of Frankfurt, led by the chaos and division plaguing the Germans, several German officials and commanders have proposed negotiations regarding peace and ending our German war effort. With the British still on our tail, a German peace could allow us to focus our attention on the decadent British Empire. The new pro-French government has been established in Nuremberg under the German nationalist Anton Drexler and a group of other French collaborators that are willing to fight against the British Empire and liberal democracy."
  French.1.a:0 "Victory at last"

  French.2.t:0 "Appointing a German Commissaire"
  French.2.d:0 "With the establishment of the Nuremberg Protectorate in the former Habsburg lands of Germany, a new question arises on the issue of German leadership. The current head of state, Anton Drexler, was the man to lead the peace treaty between the German collaborators and the French army. However, Drexler, like all German nationalists, is completely insane, corrupted by the dark Germanic spells of romantic nationalism and pagan mythology. Many among our German occupation staff even believe that Drexler is the anti-Christ himself. Thus, some have started to vouch for a new German head of state to replace Drexler. Several options have become staff favorites, but there has yet to be an official discussion about this change in management."
  French.2.a:0 "Drexler is not the anti-Christ, Monsieur..."
  French.2.b:0 "Wilhelm Kube can direct German collaboration"
  French.2.c:0 "Freikorps opposition Walter Stennes can keep Drexler in check"
  French.2.e:0 "Appoint our loyal Maurice Gamelin"

  French.3.t:0 "Anti-French Partisan Movement"
  French.3.d:0 "The recent defeat of the German army and the following peace between the Nuremberg government and France hasn't been popular among most German citizens. Many blame the German nationalists for their loyalty to France, starting the 'stab-in-the-back' myth among most urban citizens. Now, several groups of socialists, liberals and even other nationalists have formed an disunited partisan movement across Germany to keep the collaboration government from helping the French war effort. These partisan movements have already begun to become a major problem for the collaboration government and many fear all-out revolt if the French war effort were to ever turn sour."
  French.3.a:0 "Okay"

  French.4.t:0 "Formation of an Army"
  French.4.d:0 "While the Peace of Nürnberg had disbanded the standing army, France has recently send us a telegram regarding our role in the war. France expects us to support the war effort against Britain and has thus granted us the privilege of establishing a provisional land force, while restricting military developments in regards to the navy and the airforce for now."
  French.4.a:0 "Thanks"

  French.5.t:0 "Peace signed"
  French.5.d:0 "After hours of debate and threats, German diplomat and foreign minister Joachim Ribbentrop gets out of the conference room with a dissapointed look on his face. The news is quickly brought to the government in Nuremberg, detailing the effects of the new treaty regarding the army and the economy. Germany will not be able to field an army for a hundred year period and Germany will pay France 20% of its economic capacity to repay for the damage done."
  French.5.a:0 "Peace without a bit of honour"

  French.6.t:0 "Whispers in the Halls of Paris"
  French.6.d:0 "Since the ascension of the triumvirate, there has been significant political tension between the various factions. Over the last few weeks, concerns have been raised among the monarchist and left-nationalist factions of the government that Doriots ultranationalists may be plotting a coup.\n\nThough these are only rumors at the moment, there is the legitimate threat that the SP under the pro-ultranationast Darnand may attempt to leverage their considerable authority to back Doriots plans."
  French.6.a:0 "Probably nothing to worry about"
  French.6.b:0 "We should look into this"

  French.7.t:0 "Reports of SP Mobilization"
  French.7.d:0 "Whether the claims are true or not, the fact that the city streets lie empty is telling of something. Individuals have gone missing at an absurd rate, and concerns are mounting regarding the SP. Darnand hasn’t been seen for the past three days, and his whereabouts are unknown, if foul play is at hand then Maurras and Armand best be worried, given their precarious positions in the event of this hypothetical coup. Despite the internal panic local authorities have maintained a neutral attitude on the topic, promising no loyalty to either of the three candidates. Whether such promises are valid is unknown, and some have even begun to suspect that the constabulary is under Doriot’s arm."
  French.7.a:0 "Demand they end their mobilization!"
  French.7.b:0 "Issue a minor protest"

  French.8.t:0 "Doriot sends out the Lists"
  French.8.d:0 "Despite the lack of discipline, the SP proved to be a brutally effective mob. Their tactics were undoubtedly questionable, but in times of great strife the rules of “war” change; and the definition of sane in an insane world is quite the ironic remark. Men tormented both physically and mentally resorted to this state funded police force, here they could avenge all the years of pain with little jurisdiction. Their mere presence birthed fearful stares in the least humane ways possible, after all everyone knew their purpose, they simply wondered who; who would be their next victim. Would it be a Jew? A drunk? Or a young woman? They were beasts of no nation, with no grand moral leader, no fathers or mothers, no job opportunities, they were the perfect killing machines and kill they did. When Doriot handed Darnard the lists his henchmen salivated at the untold stories they were about to write, the rapes and murders of thousands was about to take place and not even God knew how to handle the situation; yet he still showed pity like all the rest."
  French.8.a:0 "The orders are intercepted!"
  French.8.b:0 "The orders are delivered as expected"

  French.9.t:0 "Duck Confit, with a Dash of Violence"
  French.9.d:0 "As night falls over Paris, members of Charles Maurras' Action Française party assemble for their annual party meeting in a Paris dining hall. Though there have been fears of potential violence at the hands of the pro-Doriot militias, little has seemingly happened over the past weeks to change Maurras' plans. The focus of this evenings meeting is the prospect of aligning with the Armandist faction of the FPF in order to unseat Doriot. Though Armand holds little love for the former monarchy, Maurras has promised reforms and concessions to the left-nationalists in exchange for their support.\n\nA final concern before the meeting begins is the issue of security. Given the incessant mood of paranoia that has fallen over Paris, it seems only natural to provide some degree of security to the attendees. Alternatively, as a means to strengthen the alliance with the left-nationals, they could be armed to provide security for the event."
  French.9.a:0 "Rely on the local authorities during the Dinner"
  French.9.b:0 "Secretly funnel arms to the monarchists"
  French.9.c:0 "Offer arms to the left-nationalists"

  French.10.t:0 "The SP Assaults the Meeting!"
  French.10.d:0 "The triumvirate had met in the palace of versailles to primarily discuss the balance of power. Tensions were high but Armand and Maurras were confident that Doriots power was weakening by the second, even if the SP had circled the table there were rumours of Darnards dissapearance and inter-service rivarly. "Ladies and Gentlemen I am proud to host the first of many meetings between us, the future of France lays in our hands, and dare I say the future of Europe." Either side looked at each other with confiriming eyes but Doriots true intentions had yet to be revealed. After a long and detailed speech Doriot rose his wine glass in celebration, "A toast to the future of France" he pronounced. But by the time Maurras and Armand had even reached for their glasses Darnard had breached the door to the dinning room with a handful of SP goons. Doriot stood still, drinking his wine whilst watching his two biggest political hurdles get shuffled away into some back alley, where they would meet their eventual death after a bloody beating. "
  French.10.a:0 "Vive Le Maréchal!"

  French.11.t:0 "The SP Attack is Repelled!"
  French.11.d:0 "Whilst Maurras and Armand were being shuffled away into their would to be resting places the SP officers tasked with executing them unmasked themselves and cut both parties loose. Stating that they were apart of the anti-Doriot faction within the SP. In a sudden flash gunshots were heard coming from within the palace and both Armand and Maurras were dumbfounded by what was happening, was this a coup of a coup? After a short while the fat bastard was brought out to in front of Maurras and Armand, pissing himself away in fear. Not a word was ushered by either side but Doriot made himself very well heard with his pleads of mercy. The SP after a small verbal conversation took Doriot away into some random back alley. All one could here that night was the screams and please for god to save whatever soul Doriot still had.   "
  French.11.a:0 "The fat bastard is dead and France is saved."

  French.12.t:0 "The Armandists turn on Maurras"
  French.12.d:0 "Great sacrifices have been made repelling the sadistic SP mob which assaulted the coalition of socialists and monarchists. However all this would be for nought if the monarchists were allowed to return to power. They still gripped the old ways of tradition and aristocracy which so willingly put the common people of France through the Great War. If the coalition must be broken then so be it.. We shall disarm the monarchists for the betterment of France and install Armand as the rightful saviour of the French people. Armand shall become the defender of France and we; the French people shall be her blazing sword, even if it means cutting off the limb of traditionalism. Paris, in all its beauty, tells a depressing story from a bygone age; its woes, its struggles, and its ascendance will all be remembered but its existence will alter beyond recognition. As the fires of revolution spread, Paris, though old, will be reborn and with it a new era of thinking shall emerge. Empires, Kings, and Queens will experience the very pain France had to suffer; the word mercy from this point on will take a sinister definition and Maurras' clique will be the first to hear it, France shall be reborn tonight."
  French.12.a:0 "A New Dawn Is At Hand..."

  French.13.t:0 "The Bourbon Restoration"
  French.13.d:0 "My fellow Frenchmen, for too long our once glorious nation has been under the shackles of hostile powers, both foreign, and domestic.  We were once a proud Kingdom!  Our empire, our culture, our history, and our army and navy were once the finest in all Europe!  But since our humiliating defeat in the Great War, we have been left a nation stripped of its ancestral lands, and shackled under a sickeningly weak "Republic" that has done nothing but sell our nation into slavery! Today, I say to you that we will tolerate this no longer!  Brothers and Sisters of France, today, for the good of all French patriots, I hereby proclaim the restoration of the French Empire!  No more shall our nation answer to our conquerors!  Let us return to the glorious days of our past and carve ourselves a new future, one where France shall rule Europe once more! Vive la France!  Vive le Roi!"
  French.13.a:0 "Vive la Empire!"

  French.14.t:0 "Armand Outlives her Usefulness"
  French.14.d:0 "As Inessa was shoved violently by the pawns of Maurras, she reflected on her sorrowful position. How pitiful her state, that the revolution would be ended right here, in such a way. The nation she loved so dearly, the people she fought so desparately to save, only to turn against her in the critical moment, and drag her through the mud. It was not her they were dooming - it was themselves. She wondered at whether her fate was inevitable; whether she was set up to fail. Or, perhaps, this was all her fault, due to some mistake or flaw. It mattered little now. As these thoughts rushed through her head, she felt a sharp pain, and everything went black - the revolution going with it."
  French.14.a:0 "Stability must be bought with blood."

  French.15.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on Degenerate Art"
  French.15.d:0 "The grand cultural reconstruction has begun. Speaking before an assembled crowd at the Louvre, Grand Marshal Doriot announced the beginning of the \"Cultural Reconstruction\" of the French State. The Marshal declared that all forms of so-called \"degenerate\" art were to be destroyed for a wave of new French artistic expression, guided by the FPF. The Louvre, he declared, would be just the beginning of this new rebuilding of traditional French culture, free from the decadence and immorality of the Bourbons.\n\nFollowing this announcement, SP militants have begun ransacking museums and art galleries throughout Paris and the country, destroying and looting countless amounts of priceless works. In the Louvre alone, much of the Republican-era modern art has been destroyed, though many of the museums most important pieces were quietly evacuated before the SP could invade. Most notably, Da Vincis Mona Lisa was reported stolen and taken to Italy by \"traitorous Maurras sympathizers\".\n\nFrance, once a cultural capital of the world, has had its' heart sliced out by the new regime. The skies around Paris blacken with the ash of thousands of burnt canvases."
  French.15.a:0 "A small cost for the future."

  French.16.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Past"
  French.16.d:0 "Yet again, the Grand Marshal addresses the nation. The next edict of the cultural reconstruction is to target Frances past, more specifically, its' Bourbon heritage. Doriot, in an effort to further cement the absolute power of the state, has ordered the mass demolition of any buildings or monuments erected by the former Bourbon monarchy.\n\n\"The weakness of the former Emperors shall not be that of the New France\", he stated to an assembled crowd in Paris. Not only this, but the former nobility of the French state, or at least those that have not already fled, are to be killed or detained. Over a hundred former civil servants, nobles, and pro-Bourbon business owners have been detained and have seemingly vanished, likely killed by the SP or the increasingly militant Doriot Youth clubs that have popped up throughout the nation."
  French.16.a:0 "The World will never know they existed."

  French.17.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Future"
  French.17.d:0 "As the Cultural Reconstruction reaches a fever pitch, the Grand Marshal has made his last edict on the matter, detailing his manifesto for the future of France. His plan is ambitious to say the least, and equally disquieting for those he has declared his regime against. A series of laws are to be implemented officially banning anyone of German heritage from public office or business ownership. Laws against Frances not insignifcant Jewish population have been enacted, with the Doriot regime declaring them as \"racial fifth columnists\" to the French people.\n\nCoupled with these new racial laws is a \"generation plan\" proposed by the regime intended to dramatically increase Frances birth rate over the course of the next decade. The Generation Plan is intended to create an \"ethnically pure\" France with a population to outgrow Europes German diaspora.\n\nAlready, thousands of German, Jewish, and other minority groups have begun a mass exodus from France. Across the nation, German border communities and synagogues burn as the SP begins to enact the Grand Marshals will."
  French.17.a:0 "Tomorrow belongs to us."

  French.18.t:0 "The Cultural Reconstruction - Edict on the Church"
  French.18.d:0 "Yet another victim of the Cultural Reconstruction has been Frances majority religion, Catholicism. While the Doriotist faction of the FPF had previously maintained neutrality on religious affairs, this was a compromise of convenience rather than ideology. Citing the pro-Catholic policies of the now purged Maurras faction, the FPF has set off a wave of violence throughout France against the Catholic Church in France in an effort to violently secularize the country\n\nSpeaking over the radio on the issue, the Grand Marshal declared \"the authority of the clergy, entrenched by the weak monarchy, is a danger to the moral fortitude of the new French people.\" This phase of the Reconstruction has proven the most divisive to the French people, a plurality of which are Catholic or at least Christian. Significant resistance has come from the countryside and many townships are under assault by the SP for their refusal to accept the new forced secularization. In the place of religion, the Doriot regime has begun to push a new doctrine of \"National Worship\", effectively attempting to craft their own new religion out of reverence for the state and the French people. Condemnations have naturally been issued by both Naples and Frankfurt, with both governments offering to open their borders to religious refugees."
  French.18.a:0 "The Church shall be swept away, as with all things against the New State."

  French.19.t:0 "The Remilitarization of Lorraine"
  French.19.d:0 "When the Kaiser enforced the Treaty of Tours onto the Bourbon dynasty German high command remained hopeful on the effectiveness such a treaty would have on preventing another World War; if only they knew. With revanchist fervour at an all time high and our armed forces rapidly expanding the bureaucrats in Frankfurt know damn well what we all want. The Remilitarization of Lorraine is but the first step in a series of processes to ensure total French hegemony in the following years, before we know it our troops will be marching through the cities of Berlin, Vienna, and Nuremberg singing and dancing like the Germans did so long ago. Yet we shall go the extra step, not only will we guarantee that Germany remains neutered from global affairs, but we will fundamentally change their society as a whole. Afterall revenge isn’t about defeating one’s nation, but to make that very nation incapable of existing, for the rest of time. "
  French.19.a:0 "The Treaty of Tours is dead."

  French.20.t:0 "French Troops in Lorraine"
  French.20.d:0 "The French Army has entered the demilitarized region of Lorraine and are closing in on our common border. This blantant breach of the peace treaties after the war and deserves retaliation!\n\nHowever it seems like that our former allies do not care enough about this issue to threaten France and it seems like we would be alone. Furthermore even our own people do not seem to be eager of renewing tensions with France over this issue. The people want solutions for their current well being and not another unnecassary bloody war.\n\nMaybe we should let this pass? The French State is no position anyway to attack us."
  French.20.a:0 "Issue a diplomatic protest"

  French.21.t:0 "Germany demands a Withdrawal"
  French.21.d:0 "Much to our chagrin, though not a surprise in any way, the perfidious Boches have responded to our current plans for remilitarization with threats of violence.  Rebuilding the French military is of the paramount importance to the security of the French people, and without remilitarization and reform we cannot hope to reclaim any of the territories we have lost.  However, if Germany is not bluffing, then we have little hope of victory against them in a full-scale war.  What action shall we take?"
  French.21.a:0 "We have no choice but to agree"
  French.21.b:0 "Lorraine is rightfully French!"

  French.22.t:0 "France Refuses Our Ultimatum"
  French.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, the French ambassador has informed us that the French state has no intentions of abandoning its plans for remilitarization.  Already, droves of Frenchmen have enlisted in the army and French troops can be seen massing at our borders.  Though victory is likely if we strike now, the political and economic repercussions of a war with the French could be severe.  How shall we respond to this flagrant violation of the Treaty of Tours?"
  French.22.a:0 "We cannot afford a war right now"
  French.22.b:0 "So be it."

  French.23.t:0 "Strategy towards Brittany"
  French.23.d:0 "Brittany, a country barely kept alive by a minority government and dependent on the whims of their protectors. Brittany, alongside many of the countries carved out of our glorious nation are artificial states. For this reason, our high command seeks to invade quickly and be done with the stain of our borders. However, an alternative has been proposed by other members of our military. To increase our global perception to avoid interference of our future ambitions, we should negotiate with the Breton government. Doing so may result in concessions like suffering these celts their own self determination through autonomy, but the potential of reclaiming the brest dockyards without bloodshed or the disdain of our rivals has its own appeal. The question ultimately lies with [GetLeader]."
  French.23.a:0 "Send a list of demands to their government"
  French.23.b:0 "No need for Diplomacy"

  French.24.t:0 "France Demands Annexation"
  French.24.d:0 "France, the nation that had us subjected for many years, has demanded that we join them, or we will be invaded. We have two options; we either concede willingly, and avoid bloodshed like cowards, or we fight like the brave men we are to defend Brittany’s independence from oppressors. We must decide quickly, as French soldiers are congregating at the border as we speak!"
  French.24.a:0 "Vive la France!"
  French.24.b:0 "Vive la Brittany! We shall resist!"

  French.25.t:0 "France Demands Wallonian Annexation"
  French.25.d:0 "Today the French ambassador has delivered an ultimatum to [Get Leader].  According to said ultimatum, as Wallonia is populated by French speakers and is historically French territory, we must peacefully integrate ourselves into the greater French nation or face total destruction.  Though we face no chance of victory alone, we could invoke our alliance with Germany and hope our former Habsburg overlords will come to our rescue."
  French.25.a:0 "Seek support from Germany"
  French.25.b:0 "We have no choice but to agree"

  French.26.t:0 "Wallonia seeks support"
  French.26.d:0 "The French demand for the annexation of Wallonia has caused shockwaves throughout Europe.  It seems that the French are back to their old expansionist ways once more.  The Walloons have requested that we honor our standing alliance with them and formally declare war on France over their aggression against the Walloon state.  Though many might consider going to war a matter of honor, some in our government hope that allowing the French this concession might satiate their desire for further expansion.  How shall we respond?"
  French.26.a:0 "We cannot help them at this time."

  French.27.t:0 "We have been abandoned"
  French.27.d:0 "The Germans, whom we thought were our allies and protectors, have informed us that they will not declare war on the French over this blatant act of aggression against our nation.  With French troops already crossing our borders, it is not a matter of if, but when we shall fall.  Despite this, morale is high among our troops.  We may give our blood, but they can never take our honor.  Rise up, Walloons!  Let us die this one last time, and give the French bastards a fight they will remember!"
  French.27.a:0 "We shall resist with all our might."

  French.28.t:0 "Germany protects Wallonia!"
  French.28.d:0 "Our plans for a swift victory against Wallonia have been suddenly dashed by honoring of the Walloon-German alliance on the part of the German Empire.  The German ambassador has already informed us that unless we back down and formally make peace with the Walloons, then Germany will have no choice but to declare war against us.  Our soldiers and generals alike would relish the opportunity to avenge the Treaty of Tours once and for all, but if we back down, we could take the time to prepare and mobilize further and make sure the Germans will be humiliated in due time.  What shall we do?"
  French.28.a:0 "We shall start the Great Struggle now, then."

  French.29.t:0 "France declares their claims on the Dutch"
  French.29.d:0 "Recent reports from our infiltrated assets within the French government seem to point toward ambitions of claiming the entirety of Dietland.  This has been further substantiated by Dutch reports of increased mobilization of French soldiers at their borders.  Though Dietland contains many natural defenses, their armed forces are small and could not hope to survive a sustained conflict with the rebuilt French Army.  Though we may shudder at the thought, with the French already having taken Wallonia, the seizure of Dietland would open up a dangerous flank on our borders and would be extremely detrimental in any future conflicts with the French.  Certain elements in our high command believe that we must answer this blatant act of aggression with war, but our diplomats believe that we could open a compromise, perhaps offering them partial concessions in exchange for dropping any further claims on the region.  Of course, we could just abandon Dietland entirely."
  French.29.a:0 "Propose a compromise for Flanders"
  French.29.b:0 "Holland is of no concern to us."
  French.29.c:0 "The concert of Europe shall not be interrupted!"

  French.30.t:0 "A Compromise with the Netherlands"
  French.30.d:0 "A team of German diplomats has invited our ambassador to Germany and his team to the recently annexed  city of Liège, where they hope to make a compromise with us and avoid war between our two nations.  Already, the commotion and shouting in the room would seemingly be a bad omen, but not all hope may be lost yet.\n\nOne German diplomat in particular has proposed a rather tantalizing offer.  In exchange for abandoning their claims on the rest of Dietland, France shall be granted the region of Flanders,  completing the annexation of all former Belgian lands into the French nation.  Of course, the Dutch have absolutely no say in the matter, and their diplomats are not present at the conference."
  French.30.a:0 "Acceptable terms."
  French.30.b:0 "We will have all our claims!"

  French.31.t:0 "Germany abandons the Dutch"

Certainly, the reunification of the Belgian lands under our righteous and just rule has been a great victory for the French people, and proven to the world that France will not accept status as a secondary power when our history is filled with glory and victory.\n\nOn the other hand, our original demands were the entirety of Dutchland. While many might favor this diplomatic solution and advise us to consiolidate our hold on the valuable Flemish lands; there are some elements of our military that believe that if we were to renenge on the agreement and follow our annexation of Flanders with a full-blown invasion of Dutchland, the Germans would be unable to respond."

If we accept, the French will declare war on any nation that attacks us, and vice versa, and putting the zealous and powerful revived French army at our disposal would certainly improve the security of our nation against the many enemies who would seek to destroy Mother Russia.\n\nHowever, this would mean we could very rapidly get involved in many foreign entanglements.  The French, ever focused on revenge for their defeat in the Great War, have made it clear in their foreign policy that this alliance could very soon evolve into one of aggression.

First she had tasted defeat against the Boche, then she had betrayed her God-given king! And now, oh now, she was betraying herself to savages not worthy of the title of Frenchman.

While there are enough potential workers in the regime’s prisons to fulfill this first quota appropriately, French authorities might have to resort to displacing any poor German citizen in the streets to keep up with Paris’s demands in the future.\n\nFurthermore, while this is expected to ease the administrative burdens of the occupation regime somewhat, the already unhappy German populace are sure to begrudge French rule even further, as their loved ones are forcibly carried away across the Ardennes never to be seen again."

About fifty thousand German POWs have already arrived at labour facilities in the regions, with more convoys expected to depart from Germany soon. The success of this initial operation will set the groundwork for further labour relocations in the future. Fifty-seven of the total sixty-one convoys arrived at their destinations without issue, while the remainder four faced minor setbacks, but ultimately achieved their goal as well.\n\nNotably, Convoy Number 38, one the convoys responsible for transiting German workers from the Augsburg Regional Correctional Facility, lost 45 workers and 3 guards after crossing a leftover minefield in a rural road near Stuttgart. The Ministry of Public Affairs has elected to keep this information confidential from the press, but a proposal for a minesweeper labour force in the area by the Ministry of Transport has been filed and attached to this document.\n\nThe labour facilities so far report no major problems in managing the newly arrived workers. The influx of workers in the Nord-de-Calais and Franche-Comté departments is expected to increase production of the recently expanded mines of the region by 20% in a few weeks if all continues to go well, as well as boost the industrial output of many factories in the area, with further improvements expected with the arrival of more workers."

Altough many of these factories were closed until now, this will prove to be detrimental to our economic reconstruction as potential job opportunities are sapped away back to Paris.\n\nUnderstandably, this action has caused a major outrage among many of our cities. One of the factories set for dismantlement, a steel mill located in Dortmund, triggered a massive public outrage, and police had to be deployed to prevent a full-scale riot from breaking out in the streets surrounding it. With an open uprising only narrowly avoided, one has to wonder how far the French can continue pushing the Germans around until tensions hit a breaking point."

Already the overflow of industrial equipment has encouraged the construction of new factories all across France, expanding employment through construction and future industrial jobs.\n\nAll of this has come at a severe cost to German workers, who are losing potential jobs with the steady dismantlement of their industrial complex. While this has increased tensions in the territory, notably Dortmund, where small riots sparked up across the city, the occupation regime has assured us that the local police is not expected to face any trouble dealing with the unrest and unemployment in the following weeks.

Though the elite units of the SP can send even the most hardened warriors of the Habsburg dogs or the perfidious Albion running, the majority seem to act like barbarians, committing petty crimes against our own citizens, especially those that practice the Jewish religion.\n\nThough our government has previously instituted certain laws intended to reduce the pervasive influence of the Jews, whom we consider inherently untrustworthy and anti-French, these criminal acts reflect poorly upon our great nation. A compromise will need to be made with our brave boys of the SP. Perhaps by offering their leader the chair of the newly created Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs, we can make sure that the Jewish question is resolved in a civilized and peaceful manner. We trust that discipline and order will be restored to the SP regiments in short order."

Though our government has often used anti-Semitic rhetoric in the past to drum up popular support, these scenes of savage ethnic violence are certainly not what we imagined.\n\nWith pogroms and riots causing fires and mass death and injury in Jewish quarters and villages all around France, a recent investigation by our internal security forces have found that culprit seems to be our new appointments to the leadership of the Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs. Though much of our government has little love for the Jews, there has been objection to these senseless acts of violence sponsored by the apparatus of our own government. Sadly, there isn't much we can do. Replacing the leadership of the Commissariat-General now might turn our own people against us. All we can do is sit in horror and hope this ends sooner than later."

Yet this mourning has given way to a rage that has driven them to not only rebuild but to reassert the superiority of France’s culture and way of life. Under France’s new nationalist dictatorship France has not only seen an economic boom but a cultural flourishing due to vast and ambitious public works programs with it seeming as though every other week some architectural feat is revealed. Most impressive of which is the statue of Charlemagne, which standing upwards of 300 metres tall straddles the Seine river, dominating the local Parisian skyline, sending a message to not only the French people but the world that France as a great power is back. With nearly double digit yearly GDP growth some economists have labelled this boom the French Miracle, with many saying that other nations struggling with the ongoing economic crisis should look to the French’s public works programs as a means of alleviating their ongoing economic woes.

Nevertheless, Armand continued with the skills of a ancient Greek orator and, when she felt the hints that the crowd was losing its attention, she finished dramatically:\n\n"I'm not here like any old politician that you've come to expect out of the old order, nor like some pompous aristocrat, too high in their towers of ivory to know the struggle of the common folk. Yet, unlike the petty bourgeoisie and slave masters of capital, I have come to you with a vision. A vision one can only get from a higher goal.

If you asked me, dear reader, it is through war".\n\nLike freshly made cakes, "A Second Prussia", the most recent book written by ex-Great War ace Jean C. Romatet, is flying over counters across the French state. Unlike many of his previous books, which are either detailed case studies of Frances defeat in the Great War from the perspective of the respected ace or deeply ideological books on French nationalism and revanchism, "A Second Prussia" is squarely a book for the masses. With everyone, from teachers and lawyers to butchers and soldiers, standing in line to get their hands on the relatively small page turner, the book has gathered a reputation for being Romatets best work yet.\n\nIn it, Romatet briefly touches upon his previous work in a light, but still genius way, and continues to predict that the recent turn in French politics through the cunning of the French army will bring France the power status in geopolitics it has always dreamed off. Coining the term "be humble, but carry a big gun", Romatet describes a future France as a second Prussia, a government ruled by the military which can properly utilise the military through ridding itself from civilian control. Foreign policy-wise, this France would scare its neighbours into a state of neutral submission to Paris, describing it as "Switzerlandization", with the explicit goal of keeping global competitors out of the European backyard.\n\nWhile genius, foreign critics have decried the book for glorifying militarism without the perspective of its bloodshed. One critic suggested even that Romatet could only be so high and mighty about the boons of war due to him being a flying ace: "a real soldier would have experienced the nastier sides of war, instead of being with his head in the clouds"."

Though the fields laid torn and permanently scarred, not too different from those long ago, victory along with all its burden was finally achieved. While some individuals are enslaved, others subjected, there are also those that have been liberated. While one may ponder on the lasting effects such a war may have, for the time being many can rest knowing mans destruction is of a future concern; that is unless old squabbles refuse to die. It is far too soon to make out whether Paris will rule the next century in a period of gold, even sooner to tell if humanity can reject its primitive ways. War, borders, and insignificant differences can make everything we’ve ever worked towards ultimately pointless. Yet it is these very issues that we as a society strive to overcome, otherwise are we truly human? While the era of British peace has finally come to an end, a new era has been birthed. Peaceful or not continental Europe will enjoy a new master, one not confined to the British ways of thought. "

  French.70.d:0 "A photo of the French and Russian foreign ministers shaking their hands and smiling into the camera adorns the front page of Parisian papers today. In bold letters, the context of this handshake is explained succinctly: France and Russia agree to formalise a military alliance, designed to right the wrongs of the global order. While a few people have taken notice to the event, the Parisian people remain relatively calm. Few truly understand how historical of an event this will prove to be.\n\nIn the centre of Frances beating heart sits the ministry of foreign affairs. While usually a grey mess of papers and ink, today it is filled with champagne and pastries. Glasses are clinked in the afternoon and diplomats celebrate the culmination of years of effort and political manoeuvring in Russia. Finally, after a barrage of little details and small promises, the foundation stood for a military alliance to rival the British and German empires. Drunk talk between diplomats mentioned an end to British hegemony, a start of a new friendship between the Slavs and the Romance and a potential defeat of Germany in the near future.\n\nAs the night progresses, more loose lips leave fewer secrets a secret. Not a single one of them realise the small devices wedged between tables, in vases and under desks, silently observing the party. If they would know who were really listening to their stories of grandeur and revenge, perhaps there would have been less champagne served and less lips loosened. Alas, notes had been made. Britain would not remain in the dark."

  French.71.d:0 "The British minister of foreign affairs could not believe his ears when talking to his German colleague. The French and Russians had shaken hands upon a military alliance, yet the Germans were far too calm about the whole affair. "Not to be rude to you, but are you fully aware of the implications", the British minister asked, hinting to slight annoyance in his voice. The calm figure of the German minister did not help at all, as he sheepishly replied "I am" without any further elaboration.\n\n"The British ministry is currently looking through a variety of possibilities in the near future, trying to listen to the advice the German ministry has given according to their perspective on the situation, but not a single analysis ended up without at least the advice of mobilising a part of the military". Tapping the papers on the table, the British ministers swift rattling of facts did not seem to impress the German minister. Again, the German minister calmly answered.\n\n"The German Empire simply doesn't share the over-pessimistic and perhaps even militaristic view of the British Empire, that seems to me to be the biggest obstacle at the moment. Perhaps its the eternal siege mentality of the bureaucrats you employ or the German experience on the continent, but we are more worried about the potential problems this may cause for market operations in Russia, France and the rest of Europe than continental peace somehow being threatened".

The men simply continued their rampage of laughter until the SP officer finally brought himself under control. The soliders quickly shut themselves up and at that moment in time the only sound that could be heard was the sobbing of the victim and the occasional barking of a street mutt.\n\n"Please, please, please... I beg of you; I gave everything to the party." Cried the victim but the perpetrators showed no remorse. The victims mind raced with thoughts and the stench of fear began to become unbearable to the officer. His hand crawled down his right leg and came to a complete stop, resting itself on the belt of a holster. The victims crying only escalated as a result and in a proccess to shut the man up a solider knocked him over the head with the butt of his rifle. The crying finally stopped and only a few snobs and sniffs remained. The officer drawed his pistol to the forehead of the victim. Silence, complete silence then followed.

  French_flavour.4.d:0 "Inside an old storage building, on the outskirts of the Orleans suburbs, the Jacobin leadership, the last bastion of the classical far-left in France, met under the hazy smoke of cigarettes and a rusty poker table. Two rugged men, the chairman and his messenger, sat across from each other. After regular formalities, the former began speaking about recent developments.\n\n“It is bad news, compatriot. Our meeting place in the city of Blois was raided by police. Dozens of our party members were arrested and killed, including their local chief coordinator. There’s only a few of them left, currently hiding in a secondary meeting place outside the city. The Securité Publique is most certainly looking for them.”\n\nBenoit Frachon was understandably furious. After Doriot’s coup in France, the Jacobin party was outlawed and driven underground. Benoit, at this point, was used to handling guerrilla operations. Or, at the very least, he was the best one the Jacobin party had to offer, seeing all of his rivals were eventually caught and executed by the SP. Benoit was their last leader standing. If he was caught, the Jacobin cause in France would be functionally extinct. Of course, he wouldn’t go out so easily. At least, that’s what he told himself.\n\n“Benoit, everything we’ve tried to do since ’29 has only got our followers arrested or shot. Is it really worth wasting so many lives for this cause?” The fellow party member argued, as Benoit remained silent. “This is a lost cause, Benoit! We need to get out of this country!”\n\nBenoit stared outside the window, which illuminated the room in a grey, bland tinge, and reflected. He sighed. “I understand your frustrations Jacques, but we just have to keep fighting. An opportunity will show itself if we stay firm.”\n\n“But even Armand’s gone down the drain!” Jacques complained, something which made Benoit finally snap.\n\n“That traitorous wench had it coming! She was never a real revolutionary to begin with!” Benoit raised his voice, banging his fist against the table, startling his fellow ally. “She would have ratted us out at the first opportunity if they hadn’t shot her dead! How dare you even compare us to her little neo-imperialist club?” Jacques winces. “At the very least, I can sleep in peace knowing my party lasted longer than hers did. And for as long as I live, I will lead this bloody party through sweat and tears until all those fascist bastards are dead along with her, damnit!”\n\nLaying back in his chair after taking a deep breath, Benoit resumed speaking calmly. “Tell whatever remains of the Blois cell to meet us in the countryside, in that barn nearby that compatriot Feintuch confirmed was abandoned. We’ll discuss our next move with them there. Understood?”\n\nJacques, shaken by the chairman’s resolve, holds back his sigh. “Understood, compatriot Frachon! Death to the neo-imperialists!”"

  French_flavour.7.d:0 "Before he could realize it, Antoine was forcefully picked up again by the same soldiers that had pulled him onto the military truck that fateful night. With his knees painfully scraping over the dirty, cold ground, Antoine received a hard fist to his jaw. “Your feet still work pig, don’t try and be petty”, the soldier holding his left arm shouted.\n\nWith the cold dawn setting in, Antoine reached the large facility on the outskirt of some random forest in the French countryside. The sounds of toiling men and women were drowned out by the sounds of iron doors and the wooden stocks of guns hitting flesh. Before he could properly take in the atmosphere, Antoine was thrown into what looked like a temporary holding cell. The door behind him shut and he was left in the dark, yet he still wasn’t alone. One other soul was also in this dark room, his or her eyes glowing with the small bit of light that came into this room through the small window. “Are you alright”, he or she asked. A soft hand touched Antoine’s elbow, feeling the bit of skin that was scraped off him by the fall into his new home. “I would have helped you, but there’s not even some linen I could use to patch you up”. It was nice that at least some people haven’t lost their humanity in these trying times, Antoine thought.\n\nBefore he could reply, the light from the window dimmed as a man stood behind it. “Rest while you still can, tomorrow is your first day of labour”."

  French_flavour.8.d:0 "The rhythm of steel on stone echoed through the quarry localized in the labour camp, as Antoine’s pickaxe followed the pattern of the other undesirables stuck there. It was a couple of months since he had been thrown into that temporary holding facility and he had since then moved to the crowded barracks near the eastern side of the camp. Once there, he was given a number and was stripped of his old clothes, having to work, sleep and eat in something that barely resembles clothing. He was, however, fortunate enough to sleep in the eastern barracks instead of the western, as a recent cholera outbreak had wiped half of the population there. Some had talked about a planned outbreak to free up space for more undesirables, but the hygiene was honestly so poor in this camp that it could have gone either way.\n\nWith the last stone broken, Antoine got his food and ate alone near the fence. From there, he could see the outskirts of the forest: a tease of freedom, of hope. As he picked up another piece of his dry bread, someone came up to him, wearing the same cloth he wore. Sitting down next to him, Antoine recognized the man that just approached him: it was the same soul he had met months ago in the holding cell. “Good to see that you’re still alive Antoine, how’s work”.\n\nAfter a short amount of chit chat between the two, the man that he now knew was called Michel started to look serious. Looking around him, Michel sneakily gave Antoine another piece of bread before he continued. “I’m guessing that you aren’t looking to waste your life in this prison camp, so I have an offer to propose. I’ve assembled a few of the others with a plan to leave this place without raising suspicion. We have a man on the outside that has promised us a trip out of France, presumably to Switzerland. We don’t have much room, but we could use someone like you to help us get out of here”.\n\nAntoine didn’t skip a heartbeat and answered:\nAlright, let’s get out of here"

  French_flavour.9.d:0 "Under the light of the moon, they had escaped their camp. Antoine, Michel and a couple of other men were now hidden in the forest near the camp, running barefoot through the mud and on the stones. It wouldn’t be long before camp security would notice prisoners missing, so they had only a few hours to reach Michel’s contact.\n\nSwiftly yet quietly, the men sneaked through the forest, watching for fallen branches and crunchy leaves. Despite the darkness, the moon allowed them to be stealthy. At the end of the night, as the sun broke through the morning dawn, they finally reached open plains. Michel pointed across the grass to a figure standing there, waving. “Our contact, he’s the one that will stow us away on a train towards Switzerland”. A sense of celebration filled Antoine.\n\nThat was when the first man fell.\n\nLoud bangs ringed through the forest as French soldiers gave away their position. It was an ambush. Our contact had betrayed us. Bullets flew across the field. Michel, barely breathing due to the wound in his chest, told Antoine his last words: “Take care, Antoine”. Antoine could not cry now, so he ran, hidden behind tall grass, bushes and trees. He ran. His feet started bleeding but he did not care. He only ran.\n\nAfter hours of running, Antoine collapsed. He was in the middle of nowhere with nobody else. All the others were presumably dead. He was alone.\n\nFor the first time in months, Antoine cried"

  French_flavour.10.d:0 "It had been a couple of weeks since the ambush, yet you would not be able to tell that from Antoine alone. His face was pale and he had nurtured wrinkles around his bloodshot eyes, yet he did not give up. He got away and he would fight for his freedom.\n\nDespite his mental state, Antoine hadn’t given up. On nothing more than his bleeding feet, he had reached Calais, the biggest city near the Franco-British sea border. Yet, as a wanted fugitive, he could not simply walk into Calais and expect to be treated well. He would most likely be shot on sight if people found out. So he waited for the sun to set, scavenging food during the night and resting in an abandoned barn outside the city. This ritual went on for a few weeks, but Antoine could not afford to stay too long in this position. People would find out eventually of his shenanigans. So he hatched a last-ditch suicide plan. If this would not work, he was a dead man.\n\nThat night, he didn’t go to Calais to scavenge. Running around the semi-busy port, Antoine finally found what he was looking for: a British ship preparing to return to Dover. Yet the vessel was not very large and most likely not one for trade. Stowing away would be fairly risky on such a small boat, yet he could always try. Leaving a bloody trail of footprints, Antoine entered the deck of the ship and hid away in a cupboard.\n\nBefore he could feel the ship depart however, the cupboard was opened. Two curious eyes stared at Antoine and Antoine stared back. In a heavy North England accent, the man with the curious eyes asked: “and who are you, just sitting in this cupboard”? Antoine did not understand English, but that did not stop him pleading in French. Tears swell up, yet the Anglo did not seem to understand him. With his hands full of dirt Antoine pleaded and pleaded, stopping to take a breath here and there, but the English sailor stopped him.\n\n“I do not necessarily understand what you’re saying, but I know a man fearing for his life when I see one”. Again, Antoine did not understand, but the sailor tried to calm him down. He pointed at the deck and made a gesture to keep quiet. For the first time since he was forcefully detained, Antoine felt good. And as the sailor closed the cupboard, planning to keep it a secret until they reached Dover, tears fell from Antoine’s cheeks.

  French_flavour.11.d:0 "Richard had often overheard the rumours his parents shared with the other Anglo neighbours. Often, they talked about one particular old man, settled in a small villa on the outskirts of Montreal. While clearly French, the man did not speak in the particular Quebec dialect of the region, but in a Parisian one. That is, if he ever spoke to you. Generally, he just mumbled while rocking in his chair with his wife, watching over his modest estate. Threats and vulgarity are often exchanged between him and the locals, may they be Quebecois or Anglo.\n\nThe main rumour Richard knows about old mister Philips is that people think he might have been in the military. Some swore they’ve seen the man walk through his front garden in a military uniform, unlike any on the entire American continent, his badges sparkling in the low spring sun.\n\nAs he walks along the estate, Richard peaks through the fence for a second. There he saw mister Philips, completely alone. Instead of his military uniform or the glorious badges he may have won during the War, the old man stared at a piece of torn cloth, painted in blue, white and red. Richard swore that he saw a single tear drop from his old face before mister Philips saw him peeking through the fence. And as he often did, the old man threatened many things to happen to Richard’s mother."

While a single project here and there suffered from either bad weather, budget issues or logistical problems, ranging from a lack of cement to lacking conditions for the penal workers, the grand picture showed an efficient and swift result. The French countryside, historically the periphery that lacked any connection to the great urban centres of France, had become more intertwined with the national. The cities themselves also got a piece of the cake, as new railway projects connected more and more parts of the country, all leading to the central heart of Paris.\n\nLouis turned away from his organised desk and opened up a panel in the walls, revealing a cool space between the walls where he held a special bottle of champagne. He wasn't much of a drinker, but Louis recognised that it was a special occasion. The grand plan was destined to succeed in the coming month and he could perhaps enjoy a more prosperous future after a nice promotion for his hard work."

However, today was a busy day due to a little problem mom had had with the police, so Pierre was given a few Francs and the task to buy a loaf of bread. With the warm loaf in his small hands, Pierre took the usual shortcut through an alley.\n\nThere, Pierre saw him. A large man in a coat, sitting on the ground. His weary eyes pointed at little Pierre, either scared or hungry. Or perhaps even both? Before Pierre fully understood the situation, the man started begging for some bread. “Please little man, I’m so hungry. I haven’t eaten in days now and my stomach hurts”. Pierre, moved by this gesture, tore some bread from the loaf and was about to hand it to the hungry man, before noticing a small, orange badge on his coat.\n\nMom had told Pierre of those people with orange badges, often in the bedtime stories she read for him. They were monsters, hungering for little boys. He had seen that hunger in his eyes just a second ago and he knew that he would be eaten. Pierre screamed. People from the busy streets swarmed the small alley in seconds, calling for the police and pulling the man from the ground, tearing at his coat. When the police finally came over, the man with the orange badge was pulled out of the alley and into a black police car. Sitting in the backseat, the hungry man looked outside and saw the little boy he had asked for bread being comforted, crying about the hungry man that was going to eat him."

That’s why we have to keep our head low and not risk our neck for the truth”. Joseph exhaled the smoke, making the already grim room a little bit more gray.\n\n“I didn’t become a journalist to write what people want to hear, Joseph, I became one to fuck up some corrupt folk and uncover some unpleasant truths”. Joseph laughed a bit before inhaling another cloud of smoke. A combination of laughing and coughing followed. “Well, why don’t you start with [FRA.GetLeader] and see how long your neck will be attached to the rest of that young body of yours”. It wasn’t a wonder that Joseph was as defeatist as he was, but it was quite a contrast to a few years ago, when he often pulled the rug under big politicians when democracy was still in place.\n\nBefore Eugene could answer Josephs sarcastic remark, the sound of car doors closing came from outside. In a few seconds, soldiers were at the doors of the building. As Joseph opened the door, he was pushed to the side of his own business, blood flowing out of his nose. Before a bit of that old spirit in Joseph could demand an answer out of that brute called a soldier, a man in a coat entered. “Monsieur Joseph, I’ve come here to inform you of some important information for the future of your little paper. If we could speak in your office under four eyes, that would be greatly appreciated”.\n\nAfter a short 15 minutes, the man in the dark coat left the building with his soldiers. As the cars in front of the building drove away, Joseph also came out of his office, defeated and still with blood running down his lip. “The ministry of media relations has decided that we’ve released threatening articles that jeopardize state security. We’re now under new management”."

While Louis chanted the same line in front of the students, he could only shake his head mentally. Girls and boys as young as 6, yet chanting their obedience to France and a system of governance none of them could truly understand. Hell, compare the punishments these little kids would get for not listening or forgetting to the punishments for an adult. They only know the consequence of sitting in the corner for a brief moment and not the fear of you or a loved one getting dragged into a truck, only to either appear bloodied and beaten or not appear at all.\n\nYet, class had to continue. Trying to gain control back over his rowdy students by clapping in his hands, Louis started the lesson on "civil society", which had become an euphemism for civil obedience training, if it meant anything at all prior to the despot. But his disdain for Doriot could not shine through to his class, knowing that at least a few of them were committed members of the youth organisation and would probably rat on anything that 'felt' like treason. So he continued.\n\nThe hour of civil society felt like a full day, as Louis had to continue on about the boons of the Doriot government, the "Marshal" providing the people with their destiny and more stuff that could have been ripped from the party manifesto, though Louis never had given that ideological rag even a glance so he wasn't completely sure. At the end, he sighed a bit, hoping for a bit that one of his students would not think too much of it, and ended class. While greeting his students with a customary "salut", a few of them turned to him and softly proclaimed "Salut Doriot!" before walking out of class. When they all left, Louis shook his head."

Don’t waste time, just give the people what they want. So you did just that.\n\n“We are all children of war. The French nation was born from conflict and has thrived when it understoodthis. It was forged not by meek parliamentarians but by soldiers, conquerors of the Saxon wasteland. When the foreign conspiracy tells you otherwise, they are doing it to make you weak. The Anglo-German menace will pillage our lands and destroy our kind. There won’t be a France when they’re finished.”\n\nA strong start. They love talking about the war because it lets them puff out their stomachs and be proud that they’ve done nothing with their lives. You know better, of course, but don’t get cocky; last time you got cocky Déat wanted your head. Keep the momentum going. Get louder. “But I am here to tell you, brave sons and daughters of France, that this next war will end differently. It will end with the destruction of all foreign elements that seek to topple us! It will end with our race ascendant and with Europe liberated from the Teutonic grasp! So I say to you, brave sons and daughters of France: do not fear them! Take your bayonets and run it through the bastards!”\n\nThey’re cheering. The best part of any performance is when your body is tired beyond measure and the crowd is begging for an encore. That means you’ve won. You are more powerful than they ever will be because they think that their will and yours are the same. Tell them that they’re right.\n\n“Our anger is made one by the state. It takes it and places in its hand a rifle and enough ammunition to drag a Teuton back to hell. All it asks of you is to grasp it and march forward. So let’s walk together.” They really like that one. They keep chanting “Doriot!” over and over again. It was a bit different from how you normally end it, but different is good when it works.

The war had turned and France found itself cornered, its allies either fallen to the forces of the Empires or having betrayed the dreams of Greater France. [FRA.GetLeader] could not ignore the hint of irony, reflecting on his speeches and ideals. A France of millennia, rivalling the great European empires of the Romans and the Habsburgs, yet it only lasted for a decade or less. He could not shake those ideas out of his head, as the sound of artillery and tripods came closer to the bunker.\n\nKing of Kings...\n\nThe end seemed closer than he'd imagine. If he had to believe the snakes of British and German radios, London had been calling for [FRA.GetLeader]s head, emboldened by their eventual success against the great French spirit. It was perhaps only a matter of "when", not "if", before [FRA.GetLeader] would be dragged before their courts, hanged like a pig for the world to spectate. Is that how he would be remembered? Like a body hanging from a rope and not the great leader he was?\n\nLook on my Works, Ye Mighty...\n\nDays passed and news did not improve. The situation on the ground seemed like an endless stream of failures. Treason was in the air, as Doriot emptied his bunker from people he once saw as allies. Last night he had an old military ally shot after he had played with the idea of bringing [FRA.GetLeader] somewhere safe, outside of the Empires reach. The treasonous thought of fleeing to Brazil was enough for [FRA.GetLeader] to snap at him and order his death. Yet, thinking about it, [FRA.GetLeader] could only conclude one thing. He had been right. It wasn't safe anymore, as it all had ended. France, his castle, had been torn down. The medicinal cabinet was still packed, despite supply problems, so [FRA.GetLeader] made the choice. The last choice."

Among the loafs and pastries, the baker shouted down a single customer, an old man with a cane. As he entered the bakery, Robert understood immediately what the problem was: through a thick, German accent, the old man pleaded with the baker to sell him something, but the baker refused the old mans request. Pointing at the sign at the door, the baker loudly proclaimed: "we do not serve Germans or Jews. Leave this bakery this second before I inform the police about you". Perhaps he was hard of hearing or desperate, but the old man continued to beg. "Please sir, not a single other baker has  allowed me to enter their store. Everything has been closed off to me. Please, find the kindness in your heart, lend to you by Jesus Christ to...", before he could finish, the baker had knocked his cane out of his hand. After a hard drop on the ground, the old man was dragged like a sack of potatoes onto the street.\n\n"Your kind of people don't worship The Lord, so don't even dare to use his name. Find it in the kindness of your heart, lend to you by the kaiser, and fuck off to Germany". The old man laid there for a bit, nobody bothering to help him up. As he struggled to stand on his legs, Robert could not help but feel a bit of sympathy. He may be German, but he was still just an old, confused man, looking for something to eat. Yet Robert did not help. He took his bread, the baker smiling at him during it all, and left. "One man can't change the world", Robert justified to himself."

None of them returned from the trenches, but I did unfortunately". A quiver of his lips let a small cloud enter the increasingly smoky room. Maurice coughed before asking if the war had affected him, striking a nerve of the man. "Yes it affected me. I would have thunk that some college princess like yourself would have seen that, being so highly educated, or at least claiming to be". Another inhale of the cigarettes smoke followed. "The main thing that left me in this sorry state was the shrapnel in my right leg. Some British plane blew my entire fucking leg open in the last week of the war. Doctors couldn't fix it so they cut it off while I was too high to given consent to such a dumb decision, but alas".\n\nWriting the details down, Maurice finally stood up from the old chair, nearly hitting his head on the low ceiling as the dark smoke clouds made way for his momentum. "You only need to sign these last documents, proving that you are willing to apply to the veterans program of the government, and you are a full-blooded Frenchman as well as a member of the party. With that done, your monthly benefit will come to you". Picking up the pen, the veteran wavered for a bit.\n\nAs the bureaucrat left his house, Michael sat down again and lit a new cigarette.

Compared to the math or history teacher, Monsieur Barthou was far more passionate about his subject and his students noticed, listening to his every word, almost entranced by his passion. “The nose, the fuller lips and the elegant jawline of every pure-blooded Frenchman is directly connected to the eugenic superiority of the Roman race. Compare that to the frail Anglo or the barbarian Hun and you clearly see the difference”. As Barthou pointed to the big brow bone of the Brit and the German, he swiftly pointed at the Italian next. “Despite their claimed ancestry to the Roman people, the Italians of today are more closely connected to the barbarians that invaded Rome and thus the Germanic people. Unlike them, the Spaniards and Portuguese possess that same strong jawline and full lipset of the Romans and Franks and are thus in a similar genetic class as the Franks.\n\nWhipping out another chart, monsieur Barthou continued his class on Frankish studies on the subject of undesirables. “Notice how the Yiddish people or the people without a state have far less in common with the European races than with the Africans or Indians. Even the brutes in Germany have a more elegant posture and more European appearance than those that pray to the Torah or those who steal”. Another picture was drawn on the board with chalk. “But the most undesirable of all people remains the Russians. A fusion of the worst of the German, the worst of the Chinaman and the worst of the Yid, the Russian is a true genetic abomination that taints the claim of being European or even being human”.

Barely any familiar faces frequent the church anymore”. The young woman before him nodded. In the last few months, fewer and fewer people from the town had been going regularly to the church. Even her own relatives, such as her four younger brothers, had been skipping church.\n\n“Ever since Doriot has been a vocal critic of religion, the church has seen fewer people come”, Father Lazare sighed. “I prayed many nights now to God that Doriot may change his ways, but it does not seem like my prayers will be answered”. Josephine nodded again. Seeing the old priest in such distress was rather heartbreaking. “And the worst part is that I’m somewhat responsible for this mess. I would have never voted for the Front if I knew Doriot would oppose the Lord’s words”. Josephine stopped nodding, looking slightly scared. Who knew if anyone else in the church was a member of the SP. If this little chat would leak, she could lose her job or her freedom. Father Lazare saw it in Josephine’s eyes and nodded. “I think that it’s better to end this chat here.

While Nancy was rather far from Louis’ old job in Marseille, government officials had richly compensated the two with a 5-year long job compensation subsidy and a free job for Louis that could sustain a bigger household. Sounding like a dream came true, the loving pair packed their bags and moved to Nancy.\n\nThe house wasn’t disappointing, being a modestly large house in the outskirts of the city. Louis did notice how quiet the neighbourhood was, almost as if it was devoid of any life, but the official promised that it was just for a couple of weeks, as other French pairs would also move into Nancy in a month. The house itself seemed fine, though it still had a fair share of problems that needed fixing, such as a few broken doors, random pieces of glass spread across the living room and blackened stains on the attic floor. However, despite its problems, Louis and Marie loved it and quickly moved in.\n\nOn a lovely Monday evening, while fixing up the house here and there, Louis was up in the attic, replacing some rotten wooden planks with new ones. However, when he tore open the last rotten plank, he found something behind the old planks. Pulling it out of the cobwebs, Louis held a large piece of fabric in the shape of a flag. On it was a proud black eagle flying over a yellow background. That same day, Louis would burn that proud eagle in his backyard.

Yet, knowing the man personally, Doriot saw everything but an opportunist in Barthélemy. In actuality, Barthélemy was radical and violent: a fine fit to be Doriots hand.\n\nA man disappointed by revolutionary promises never being delivered, Barthélemy turned to Doriots French ultra-nationalism as an example of adult socialism, born out of violence and Darwinian strategy of might making right. The relationship between the two man, despite Bárthelemy making a good fit, has been strained since the beginning due to Barthélemy. Initially in charge of the partys personal paramilitary, his violent tendencies were useful to a revolutionary Doriot. Today, however, the best Barthélemy can do is intimidate the few political opponents left. Strip away his violent indulgences and you would have not a drip of talent left. Yet, due to his seniority and loyalty to the party, Doriot put his butcher into a position of being an useful butcher, though making sure that any consequential power was stripped away from Barthélemy.\n\nIt's a dreadful affair, so much could Doriot agree with. A revolutionary in an orderly hierarchy of state was like a bull in a china shop: bound to break something in the near future. But until that near future, Barthélemy was a good goon to have around. A combination of a lack of spine, a relatively powerless position, no talent and few if any friends or allies, Barthélemy was a dog without claws or teeth.

While not one for politics, the father could not help but praise the work of Maurras for reinvigorating a new generation of Christians in France through more public exposure, closer relations with the Pope and significant funding for local communities, such as the new church they were planning to build in Marseille.\n\nAs the communion went on, the father noticed more people sneaking into the already packed church, perhaps a bit late due to work or family business. It didn't matter really: God had time for everybody, everywhere. As the last prayers ended and the people slowly left the church, a few new faces came up to the priest and thanked him for the service. Small talk confirmed to father Gustave that these new faces had been rethinking how often they visited the church after a recent radio ad coined the question. Questions about being a good christian and what it entailed had made them realise that they should have visited more often. A few of these talks ended with promises to visit more often, which father Gustave thanked them for with delight.\n\nAs the church was finally empty and the father cleaned up his place of work and worship, he turned on the small radio in the corner of the building. As he was putting away the scripture, a deep voice on the radio asked the father the question everybody had been wondering apparently:"

  French_flavour.49.d:0 "Having been deaf since a young age, Maurras had been used to live like this for decades at this point. It is hard, being a public figure who is that hard of hearing, but being loud in the social circles he inhibited wasn't much of a problem compared to the pre-revitalised upper society where small talk was held on the lowest possible volume. Ironically, his deafness helped him rise in the monarchist movement with a loud and vocal mouth, sticking out of the other loud orators who did not experience the need to be loud.\n\nYet it still was difficult to live this way. Airing this feeling to a personal friend, Maurras learned about a doctor in Paris with experience in treating the deaf. While Maurras didn't feel fully comfortable with the idea of a metal, unnatural piece sticking out of his ear, his friend was enthusiastic enough to push him to at least try it. Agreeing to an appointment and eventually arriving in the personal clinic of this Parisian doctor, Frances leader was presented with what looked a relatively bulky mechanism. While the nervous doctor tried to explain it with as much detail as possible, Maurras could not shake the uneasy feeling he had for this robotic piece. Yet he gave in and went on with the procedure.\n\nIt had been an extremely painful week since the operation. The doctor had advised him to not remove the white cloth wrapped around his head and ear until bleeding had stopped, but the pressure put on his cranium was too much to handle for the ruler of all French people. As he removed the cloth carefully in front of a mirror, he soon saw his ear, crusted by blood, and two small wires that wrapped behind his ear. Tapping them slightly, another wave of pain was felt, but he quickly let go of his head. Did he hear the metallic sound of the copper wires?"

  French_flavour.50.d:0 "In dictatorships, government-politicians are often afraid to go against the party line, as "the walls have ears". Yet in the French state of Maurras, the walls do not need ears, for they already have Alibert.\n\nRaphaël Alibert, born to a catholic family and lawyer by trade, has been a natural pick for Maurras as his right hand man. Few men are as intensely loyal to Maurras and the concept of monarchism as Alibert. Alibert has been a close friend to king Jean d'Orleans and his son Henri, having tutored the young boy from an early age in the ways of state. During the same time, Alibert formed a strong bond with Maurras as his most loyal followers, being present at each public appearance of the leader. Devote to the cause, Alibert has a habit of keeping an eye out inside the party, sometimes informing Maurras about ongoing and potential problems among their ranks. A few figures have been removed in the wake of his work, making him a dreaded figure to be around for most government officials.\n\nBeyond his fanaticism and devotion to the cause, Maurras doesn't know much about his catholic compadre. Alibert is a man of secrecy, preferring his lifestyle to be modest and not flashy, only shining through in his constant loyalty to the French monarchy and the restoration. He has written books and leaflets, dispensed a lengthy amount of ideological ideas on paper, so the lawyer makes for a good minister in Maurras' government. As long as he isn't pestered about his private life, the machine from Saint-Laurent-les-Tours keeps running."

  French_flavour.51.d:0 "The halls of the empty office, on the Rue Caumartin of Paris, was not often filled with laughter this late in the evening. Yet on this night the bombastic laugh of Maurras and the more timid voice of his friend Pujo echoed through the building. Clinking another set of wineglasses, Maurras and Pujo celebrated alone tonight, thinking of the tough battles the party had fought to get to the point they were now. A close circle of like-minded thinkers and friends, the monarchists had brought French republicanism to its knees and replaced it with the old, reliable ways of monarchy. Loud proclamations were shared among the two, ranging from casual anti-semitism to promises of a glorious, French future.\n\nAs the bottle on the desk became emptier, the two friends reflected on their past together. "If it wasn't for the horrors of the Great War and the damage it brought to France, I would have perhaps never known you brother Maurras. It was only then that I realised the system was broken and that we had to go back to how things were before the war", Pujo said, though slurring his speech a bit. Maurras shook his head a bit, lost his balance for a second and held himself up with the support of the chair he was leaning on: "perhaps, but it is also possible that we could have met without a war like this one. In a different world, in a different France, we would have still been together, for that is how God intended it. Probably".\n\nA rare few seconds of silence followed, with both of the two looking down their glass. "Hey, Pujo". As a silent Pujo looked up, Maurras picked up the empty bottle of wine. "How about we take this formal gathering home? If my memory doesn't fail me, I should have a bottle for special celebrations in the cellar"."

Tapping his fingers above his ear, Eberhard handed over his identification paper. The man behind the desk looked at his papers, eventually raising an eyebrow. A disapproving stare answered Eberhard’s nervous laughter. “Sorry, but krauts cannot be part of the proletariat or the union”. The disapproving stares now also came from the queue behind him, as people mumbled insults and vulgarity in French. “How’s that fair”, Eberhard replied, “aren’t we all brothers in labour, chained by the international bourgeoisie? How can one not be part of the proletariat due to nationality”.\n\nThe man slammed the desk, while the people behind him became silent. “Listen you imperialist, reactionary thought is in your blood. You simply can not be German and part of the international proletariat. You’re a capitalist in your genes and not allowed in any French labour union”. Eberhard stood there, silent. “Here are your papers and note that you’re barred from ever becoming a member of any labour union in France due to your German heritage. We all share a government blacklist and Germans like you are generally on there”.

Breaking every single barrier to entry for women, ranging from military service and education to basic sexual liberties, Armands hammer to reactionary thought has become big news even internationally, with France becoming an overnight champion of the womens rights.\n\nIn a radio broadcast to "Le Voix du Peuple", the biggest state broadcaster, Armand proclaimed that a revolution with only half the population is not a revolution at all. She defended her choices as a guarantee to the revolution, allowing for more protection to revolutionary and French ideals. She also went on to lambaste the few that had opposed her choices in private, calling these figures reactionaries and agents of anti-revolution, yet it remains unclear to who she was referring to as nobody in the party would seem to oppose her in the current revolutionary atmosphere.\n\nWhatever the case may be, this unprecedented liberation has drawn eyes from across the globe. Suffragette and feminist movements in Britain, Germany, the Commonwealth countries and South America have rallied behind the decisions made by Armand, though while some have been vocally supportive of the regime to boot, many seems still uncomfortable to link the movement to a nationalist and authoritarian government like the one in Paris."

It was her change in course that led to many former party member shedding their old revolutionary skin, revealing the anticipated colours of reactionaries and capitalists ready to skin the revolution alive. A response was needed and Armand would give one.\n\nThe streets of Paris were relatively empty this day when a large group of people started marching through it. Rallying behind people with royalist and ancien régime flags, it became clear that this was just another group of old party followers that felt betrayed by the promise of revolution, despite having been so vocal about revolution for the years before Armand. Yet, unlike the previous protests, the group was met with a small group of armed men and women. Carrying rifles and decorated with the same red shirt and black beret, the group opened fire on the protesters. Looking down from their balconies, people looked frightened by the red shirts cleaning up the streets when the protesters had fled the scene, taking the bodies they had created into military trucks.\n\nThe streets of Paris now were clean and remained so for quite a bit now. While scenes like the one on that day haven't repeated, the mere presence of a few red shirts on the corners of the streets remind people of the slaughter. Once in a while, you see these figures smoking, their rifles on their back, watching what is happening on the streets. Sometimes, a couple of red shirts pick up people from their own house, office or a bar, dragging them into alleys or trucks. The advice on the streets is to just pretend they aren't there."

  French_flavour.59.d:0 "Small chat between ministers wasn't very usual in the Armand administration, with many exercising a restraint but respectful relation among colleagues. The relation between first among revolutionaries Armand and her second in command,  Hubert Lagardelle, wasn't much different than the relations among the various ministers. Yet both had time for at least a coffee break during the endless decrees and paperwork, allowing both some limited time together, talking about the state and what the future would hold. Armands energy complimented with Lagardelle, a man of high expectations who was easily to disappoint and hard to catch slacking around. A man who wanted nothing less but to do his own work, he was the perfect fit for a second hand in such a chaotic world as this one.\n\nSipping from her cup, Armand looked up to Lagardelle. After putting the cup down on the table, she asked: "Lagardelle, do you recon that everything is going fine?" A moment of silence, as Lagardelle recollected himself after such a honest question came out of left field. "In what way", Lagardelle replied, unsure of how to answer such a question from Armand. "Well, generally. Do you recon that the state of affairs is desirable". Again, Lagardelle wasn't sure how to answer such a vague question. This wasn't the usual chat he had with Armand, so frightening ideas started to slowly wander through his minds. Perhaps a test of some sort? Would she do that? Armand wasn't a Doriot, but Lagardelle wasn't taking chances with the most powerful person in France.\n\n"I would say so". Unconvincing words left an unconvinced mouth. Armand, though not showing it, was taken a bit aback by Lagardelle. Was something still not in order that she didn't know about? She stood up after finishing her coffee and nodded to Lagardelle. "Thank you for your answer". Leaving Lagardelle alone in the room, Armand gave him the time to reflect upon his answer."

  French_flavour.60.d:0 "It wasn't often that Armand had the time to sit and drink tea with someone like-minded, but rarities happen. On a pleasantly cold afternoon, Armand was invited to the recently renamed Peoples University of Paris for a selected gathering of professors. While perhaps a bit too upper class, Armand still went. While entering the still rather formal university halls and slowly going through the professors present at the gathering, another woman quickly captured Armands attention among a rather male-dominated party. She did not need to introduce herself, as the woman professor shook her hand, a clear spark of understanding in her eyes. "Nice to meet you comrade Armand. If I may introduce myself, I am professor de Beauvoir".\n\nA few hours went by as Armand and de Beauvoir spent talking to each other. Small talk about politics turned into more difficult subjects regarding the deeper understanding behind the politics. While the energetic Armand wasn't one to get bested on a subject like equality of the genders, one could not argue that de Beauvoirs understanding on the issue was perhaps a tad deeper, as even Armand had to struggle with her different trains of thought. But still, the talk continued.\n\nWhen the party came closer to a conclusion, Armand did end up talking some more to the rest of the professors on contemporary problems and the likes, with most of the professors either agreeing intensely or keeping their opinions for themselves and asking Armand more questions, sometimes even shifting topics. Despite that, when it was almost time to end the formal meeting, de Beauvoir came up to Armand for a last time, thanking her for being at the gathering this evening. Formalities were exchanged between the two before Armand left the university.\n\nWhile being driven home, she felt more than ever that she was doing the right thing for France, even if some eggs needed to be cracked."

A single Frenchman looks at his watch, scuffing that he would have expected the parade to begin anytime now.\n\nWhen the clock strikes 12:00, the rumbling of engines fills the Parisian air. Stepping in unison, the soldiers of the first revolutionary battalion march along the wide street as people wave their small red flags, chanting their praise for France and the military while red shirts keep an eye on the situation. After the first battalion comes a battalion of motorised vehicles, driving slowly with soldiers waving from the sides at the crowd. After the trucks comes the proud first landship brigade, showcasing Frances latest military equipment to the public. As the landship brigade circles around the Arc de Triomphe, Armand herself shows up to a jubilant crowd. With the giant flag of France waving from the monument behind her, Armand starts speaking into the microphone: "People of France, my brothers and sisters, comrades from across the nation".\n\nAs Armand finishes her speech on the French Revolution and the purpose of the revolutionary red army, the crowd starts to cheer as loud as ever. Behind her, loyal generals and party members clap, nodding their heads in agreement with her message for the French proletariat. As the last landship battalion moves across her left, saluting the first among revolutionaries, Armand makes a fist and raises it in the air.

No sooner had he graduated from his class with descent scores to find himself in a post-coup France, administered by military bureaucrats and governed by commanders. He can still remember the frustration of having to get his degree through the new desks in city hall, as Paris mandated a new system of educative degrees for future teachers. Having to struggle with the soldier they had temporarily appointed to replace the old bureaucrats had taken days, just to get the approval and license to teach.\n\nNow he finally stood before the classroom, or at least he would be standing in the classroom if he wasn't forced to organise a field trip to the military parade that had been planned. When he received that letter he could only shake his head. What would a child learn from standing there, listening and viewing military propaganda and absorbing it like a sponge? Nothing really, but the purpose wasn't to learn, at least, in the ordinary sense of learning important things, like maths.\n\nYet there he stood, standing in the rain with his class, waiting for the military to goosestep through the city. Before Jean-Pierre could rain on this parade any more, the sound of rubber boots came from afar. A little minute later and the soldiers of the French armed forces marched past his nose. While the children looked in awe at the men with rifles, trucks and landships, Jean-Pierre tried to keep his eye on his watch. As soon as they could, they would leave."

To his side sat marshal Giraud, clouding his side of the salon with a cigar, probably of Cuban origin. Tapping the ash into the silver tray on the table, Giraud started talking to Noguès, who had been going through some papers on the other end of the table.\n\n"If I understand you correctly, marshal Noguès, than I have to air serious doubts about the proposed plan put forward. We've succeeded in ending the old reign of terror, but we're planning to chance little about it? Why did we even jeopardise our careers and lives in the first place than". Weygand kept himself from nodding, but could slightly agree with Girauds interpretation of the situation. Noguès shuffled the papers he had to his side. "The plan isn't optimal, Giraud, but we don't have lots of choice. The network that gave us the advantage in this coup is essentially not that different from Doriots old circle and I can't especially blame them. Revanchism is a common feeling among military men, bureaucrats and the general public. We're in need of their tacit approval, so we'll have to keep the old revanchist institutions in place if we want to continue governing".\n\n"Replace one dictator with a more sane group of dictators", Giraud huffed while biting on his cigar. Noguès replied: "You can't sustain a government on principals or ideals. Power only really grows from money or guns and we're currently facing a potential lack of both". Giruad shook his head again, but more so out of desperation than principled disapproval. The men along the table stood up and, despite the tense energy in the air, shook hands.

Still, the strong smell of rotting meat hanged around him, forcing him to mask his half hearted attempts to gag.\n\nThen, with the start of pagan chanting, the man on the opposite side of the circle came forward. Antoines questions swiftly turned into concern as the man, a face he could not recognise due to the mask he wore, approached the goat and got on his knees. He could only watch in horror as a chunk of flesh was torn from the body and was smeared across the face and white dress, staining it with a sickly red and yellow. Despite the stoic appearance of the masked man during all of this, Antoine swore that he could a few belches. As the now bloodied man returned to his place, Antoines heart skipped another beat: the next in line approached the goat and did the same thing.\n\nAs the ritual progressed, Antoine saw mixed reactions. Some of them did not crack, their facade of calm collection not breaking under the rancid smell. Others, however, were naturally inclined to turn their nose away, gasp for air for a second or even dry gag for a bit. He saw a few familiar faces throughout it all: young cadets of the SP, members of the same barrack he resided in that got him into this position in the first place. Antoine couldn't do more than curse them all to hell for this.\n\nEventually, it was his turn. Standing over the now mangled corpse, something that used to resemble a dead goat, Antoine couldn't hold his facade. With tears in his eyes, but remaining silent while his back was to the group, he readied himself for a handful of goat."

Juliette, in a bid of desperation to find her fiance, had asked around throughout the neighbourhood, with little success. "Despite my warnings", Bernard could only think to himself, increasingly fearing that the SP was indeed behind young Renées disappearance.

For the last few months, that inconspicuous storage building in suburban Orleans where the Jacobin leadership met had seen a lot less movement. But perhaps, that was soon about to change.\n\n“Jacques, who’s that contact of yours, then?” Benoit enquired, still on the same chair as always, reshuffling a deck of cards on his hands.\n\n“Calls himself Eugen Fried. Envoy of the Jacobin Party in Hungary. He’s got the badges and all.” His fellow compatriot responded.\n\n“And you’re still confident he’s trustworthy?”\n\n“Well, I don’t see why a fellow Jacobin would turn on us, Hungarian, French or else.” Jacques coughs up some cigarette smoke before continuing. “He offered us a crate of radio equipment to establish connections with his network, and even a cache of guns as an added gift. Says he’s got contacts all across Germany and Italy. If that is true, we might be able to truly start making an impact here in France with their help.”\n\n“Chairman,” Jacques said, this time bending closer to his fellow compatriot, “This has to be the opportunity we were looking for.”\n\nBenoit simply nodded, realizing the serious implications this would have for them. Could this be it? Were they finally getting the chance they were looking for? Benoit tried to contain his restlessness as best he could, setting the deck of cards on the table and looking up at Jacques. “Let’s have a look at that radio equipment, then.

Their location had been compromised, and the two Jacobins barely escaped from the location in time before the police forces arrived. They now found themselves in that run-down barn in the rural outskirts of the city on a starry night, with a small window of time to catch their breath.\n\n“I can't believe you got there before the police did. I really owe you for risking your life to inform me.”\n\n“I wasn't gonna leave you behind, compatriot Frachon. Who do you think I am?” Both men shared a laugh, a short respite from the desperate atmosphere.\n\n“So who do we have left? Did you send someone to inform Feintuch about this?” Benoit asked.

He was captured and executed by the SP a few hours ago.”\n\nBenoits face goes pale, as everything dawns on him in that instant. “Then… That must be why they discovered our hideout, right? Feintuch must have been tortured to tell them. He was the only one who knew about our location besides us!”\n\nJacques silently nodded. “No, Jacques, not my Polish fellow!

If we can make it there, we'll be able to extradite ourselves to Hungary with their help. Everyone's making a mad dash there, but we won't meet up with the main group as to not attract more attention to them.”\n\nComing back to his senses, Beniot remains in silence for a few seconds, still processing everything that is happening.

Eventually running out of food and water, they didn't get very far before a police detachment found and caught them both. While Frachon was being arrested, Jacques attempted to make an escape, but ended up being shot in the process. Beniot couldn't do anything, but watch his closest ally die right in front of him, unable to properly thank him for saving his skin from the SP in Orleans. After that, it was all a blur. Now he finds himself tied up on a pole, moments away from his own death. He had completely and utterly failed. But he wouldn’t have much time to grieve over the circumstances.\n\nThe officer gives the call, and the men open fire. A searing pain overtakes his entire body, until eventually his senses start dissipating.\n\nAs he bleeds out from the bullet wounds and the world slowly fades away from his view, Frachon wonders if he could have done anything different. He fought for as long as he could, saw many of his friends die or never come back, but yet, he persevered. At the very least, he outlasted Armand’s clique, a thought which made him chuckle. The history books certainly wouldn’t remember him, but he was still happy. Perhaps happy for being the last one standing. His efforts brought the party farther than he ever expected. And now, it was time for him to rest, along with Reynaud, Jacques Duclos, Feintuch, and everyone else he had lost. He was proud of them for dying for what they thought was right."

  French_flavour.73.d:0 "“Benoit Frachon, you have been charged with Treason and Conspiracy Against the Revolution. The penalty is death. Do you understand?”\n\nBenoit nodded. To think Armand and her clique would not only best the Jacobins, but also the neo-imperialists that plagued France for so many years, was simply embarrassing. His group didn't have much time to react when they were captured by the Armandists, but a few hours after Armands takeover. Apparently, someone in their circle knew of their location. He kept his head low, as the formalities slowly gave way to his inevitable demise. He could notice it on some of the guards, too, that they were reluctant to execute a fellow revolutionary. Inessa Armand had chosen to watch the execution of the Jacobin leader in person, however, in part to instill more pressure on the guards involved. “Before you is a traitor of the revolution, compatriots!” Armand exclaimed, marching closer to the Jacobin.\n\nIn the past, Benoit and Inessa had worked together as allies in Paris for the Jacobin cause. And now, after Inessa’s coup, they meet again. Not as allies, but as enemies, and with one having bested the other. He can’t help but regret dooming his allies’ fates to be just like his. “Ready! Set!” Inessa exclaimed, words which pulled Benoit back from his internal thoughts one last time.\n\nThe officer raises his gun to Frachons head, yet his resolve remains absolute, unflinching. Frachon slowly closes his eyes, as the last words he would ever hear enter his ears: “The revolution is dead. Long live the revolution. Fire!”\n\nA bang. And then, silence."

Eventually many Americans crossed into France in the thousands after hearing promises of greater employement and pay.
