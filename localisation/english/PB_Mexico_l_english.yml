The placebo democratic institutions of the nation has slowed this era of embarrassment to a crawl however the very real threat of a §RJacobin§! takeover threatens any hopes of a fair and legitimate national election this year. While the §gJunta§! may have pressed the Emperor's hand to accept some form of democracy to the nation it could quickly fall apart if the stability of the Junta and Royal House are put into question by the Mexican people.\n\nMexico's greatest threat would undeniably be §RGreat Britian§! and the §RUnited Commonwealth§!. Both pose a geo-political threat to the nation by their open support for the northern breakaway states. Should push come to shove both Paris and Moscow may find a new friend in a continent half an ocean away.

  PB_MEX_Agustin_IV_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 1/2/1880\n\n§YAgustin de Iturbide IV§! was never born into the days of Mexican glory, having just missed the chaotic revolutions of 1878 that saw the North and Yucatan break free from North America's once largest nation in both size and economic relevance. Spurred from continuous neglect from Mexico City and an increasingly hostile national identity towards Mexican rule saw California, Tejas, Rio Grande, Sante Fe, and finally Yucatan break free from the once prestigious Mexican empire. Agustin de Iturbide III would soon commit suicide following the birth of his son as a result of his deteriorating health following the Crisis of 1878 leaving the empire in an even worse state than before the king’s death. Being a child emperor meant many tasks were delegated to close family officials and friends, of whom were mostly members of the Mexican army. The end result being a man who would eventually be moulded by the words of corrupt, foolish, and indecent career politicians.\n\nMexico would quickly enter the darkest age of its history, with the king continuously being subjected to ridicule and disobedience, further exacerbating the already ailing nation. With the county on its last legs a lifeline was thrown to the king in the form of a new democratic mandate that would strip the king of his powers and give more authority to the king’s vast collection of council members. However, this only strengthened the power of Mexico’s corrupt and soon the Empire of Mexico would become nothing more than a country squeezed for every single ounce of profit it could produce, however a diseased cow can only feed so many mouths."
  MEX_gustavo_olivares_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 25/11/1885\n\n§YGustavo Sáenz de Sicilia Olivares§! was once a Mexican film director, producer, and writer who produced movies such as Aguiluchos Mexicanos and La boda de Rosario. Gustavo would seemingly remain as nothing more than an influential individual of Mexico’s film industry, however the ever-dire status of the nation, the increasingly popular Jacobin party of Mexico, and an economy in free fall seemingly fuelled Mr. Sicilia’s hatred of the far-left, and oddly those of Asian descent, namely those of Japanese descent. No one event had influenced Gustavo’s political opinions but instead a slow, gradual poisoning of the mind had ultimately convinced the now sole dictator of Mexico that Neo-Imperialist ideology was the nation’s only hope. Inspired by Prussian-French far-right political developments of the late 1920s and early 30s, Gustavo would come to found the National Rejuvenation Party of Mexico in 1928 alongside his brother Enrique. The party is extremely antisemitic, anti-Asian, middle-class orientated, and fervently pro-catholic. Gustavo has inherited a broken nation alongside his loyal paramilitary group the gold shirts, the question now is whether he will revive the Mexican spirit, or fracture what ever little is left of it like all those before him."

  PB_MEX_The_Sick_Man_Of_America_desc:0 "The Empire of Mexico is a shell of its former self, its economy, military, and its general prestige has been in a state of rapid decline. Few can recall a day when they were proud to be Mexican and fewer can say they welcome the Emperor with open arms. With the upcoming national election in April many within the Junta fear a Jacobin takeover and should such a outcome occur then Mexico's short taste of democracy, no matter how flawed, will come to a crashing halt. Mexico's days are numbered and if she plans on rebuilding her empire of old she will need one hell of a miracle."

  PB_MEX_The_April_Crisis:0 "The April Crisis"
  PB_MEX_The_April_Crisis_desc:0 "As predicted by the ruling Junta the Frente Unido Mexicano has defeated all political opposition in a major landslide victory. However to much surprise from the Mexican population the Junta and Agustin IV have jointly banned and declared the Frente Unido Mexicano as a foreign sponsored terrorist organization, pointing the blame to none other than Japan. While Tokyo has rejected any idea of conducting any sort of subversive activities against Mexico the fabricated claim from the Junta was more than enough to see the vote from the Jacobin party no longer considered accurate. As a result of this sudden measure Mexico and its so-called empire have now entered a stage of political violence never yet seen."

  PB_MEX_Address_The_Banditry_Issue_desc:0 "Much of the North lays subject to roaming bandits which has caused a large loss of political support from the region, and is likely why the Mexican Revolutionary Committee was able to gain such a foothold over there in comparison to other states. We must wash these lands of such vermin and restore Imperial rule if we wish to avoid an all-out civil war."

If we continue to let such actions slide, we may face a bureaucratic void of educated persons within the Junta, by enforcing or intimidating these ministers we can ensure that this nation has the full support of its ministers at the very least. Although many may not take kindly to such extreme actions. "

Individuals once politically opposed have found common ground in their fervent opposition for the current government. If plans aren't made on how to isolate these political threats then all hell may soon break loose.

Augustin IV in the streets of Mexico City had announced a new century for the Empire of Mexico, one centred around the rapid expansion of the nation’s economy, military, and territories. Whilst few criticisms could be heard from the crowd of spectators most of the emperor’s audience cheered in patriotic delight.

There are those in the northern territories who resist our control. We cannot allow any chance of an uprising to occur, to this end we must begin a campaign of consolidation in the north.

To this end, the Empire has launched a comprehensive training program designed to equip workers with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the modern economy. This includes vocational training, education programs, and other initiatives aimed at boosting productivity and improving the overall quality of life for workers.

  mexico.1.t:0 "The Guadalajura Raid"
  mexico.1.d:0 "Very early this morning, a group of criminals broke into the vault of the national bank in Guadalajara. The robbers used the sewer system to get underneath the vault and drill up. When the police arrived in the sewer tunnel, it seemed they’d been working on this for a while as many items could be found down there to indicate that, such as mattresses, food, a couch among other things. \nAfter some calculations and administration, it has been calculated that about a hundred thousand pesos has been stolen from the bank. They stayed unnoticed because outside, presumably some friends of the robbers, had caused a scene outside by playing some music and starting some festivities, which took most of the local authorities attention. It is also not known yet whether any of the bank employees were bribed or in on it in any way yet, tomorrow an investigation will be started by the Guadalajara police with aid from the government."
  mexico.1.a:0 "Those scum wil pay!"
  
  mexico.2.t:0 "Yucatan Border Skirmish"
  mexico.2.d:0 "This afternoon a small fire fight broke out between the Yucatani and Mexican border garrison. Sources believe it broke out because one of the Yucatan soldiers stepped on Mexican soil, which has been illegal since a year after their secession from Mexico. The border between our two countries has been closed since that secession, nor is trade allowed. But because of frequent smuggling, refugees and various other reasons, both our countries have agreed to uphold a permanent border garrison on both sides of said border. Although there are diplomatic relations between Yucatan and Mexico, in case of incidents like these, these relations can get heated and create tension in the area between the two armies who are stationed there. Thus far luckily both sides have stayed calm and decided to come to a conclusion together and figure anything out if needed. No one died in the incident and one person was shot in the arm during the fire fight, but he did not have to go to the hospital."
  mexico.2.a:0 "What do they want"
  
  mexico.3.t:0 "Uruapan Railway Strike"
  mexico.3.d:0 "Due to heavy rainfall, worthless wages and general spite for their jobs and bosses, railway construction workers decided to go on strike and incite a small revolt just after their lunch breaks. At that time in the day about 9 millimetres of rain had fallen, making it almost impossible to properly construct the railway, but the boss decided it was fine and told them to keep working. They didn’t and started protesting, it was pretty peaceful to begin with until one member broke mentally and punched one of the higher ups who were present. At that moment all hell broke loose. Some of the higher ups started shooting at the dozens of railway workers. This chaos continued till 10 of the workers were either shot or hit in the head with a tool. Despite all this, the railway workers returned later that day to fulfil their quota. Still utterly wet."

  mexico.4.t:0 "Como Una Piedra Rodante"
  mexico.4.d:0 "Como Una Piedra Rodante, a new book freshly released by Dilan Villacrés. It almost immediately became a bestseller, and is widely available in most book shops across the country. Although the true meaning of the book is unknown, the story is about a girl who was born into a rich family who loses all their wealth, and by the age of 20 the girl is forced to plea for food on the many streets of Mexico city. Many things happen to her while out there. She also tries to apply for several jobs, but is refused because of her state of life and lack of skills. It is a bumpy ride for the girl, who is clueless of the true meaning of life and death. Nor does she know what happened to her family. She is invisible to the world. It is also unknown whether the story takes place in Mexico and is supposed to reflect upon the country’s current state. A truly compelling story with many twists and turns, perfect for the average reader."

  mexico.5.t:0 "Ecuadorian Refugees"
  mexico.5.d:0 "With the current ongoing conflict between the Ecuadorian Revolutionaries and the Gran Colombian government many people have decided to flee the country. Some have fled to the Galapagos islands, others have spread out amongst South American countries. Many went to Peru, the Acre Republic and Brazil. But in this case about 150 people together bought a boat and made their way north, hoping to avoid the Gran Colombian pacific fleet. After being successful in doing so they went through a major storm which everyone survived. After 5 days of sea travel they landed on our pacific coast. Where they were welcomed by the locals. The officials there were informed of their arrival and eventually the central government, who decided to officially give asylum to them and any future Ecuadorian refugee who should flee during the war."

  mexico.6.t:0 "Zacatecas Water Crisis"
  mexico.6.d:0 "Near the north of the country, there is a desert region called Zacatecas. Recently because of the extreme Mexican summer heat, wells all throughout the reason have dried up. Many people are fearing a water famine might occur in the region. Already we’re seeing significant negative impact on the area and population because of the drought. A few older people have even died because of dehydration. Plus this will likely lead to a crop failure later down in the year. Though the government hasn’t issued an official response to the matter, it is expected that they will assist the people there within a week or so."
  mexico.6.a:0 "We must help those people!"

  mexico.7.t:0 "New Military Academy"
  mexico.7.d:0 "After much delay, budget cuts and protest by the locals the Toluca Military Academy has finally been built and has gone into use immediately. Many of the locals objected to the construction of the academy, but many people also greatly welcomed the academy. They believe it will bring more prosperity to the region as new soldiers have to spend their days here training. Especially local police chief Mario Murillo was enthusiastic about the coming of the academy as he believes the greatest thing to do is to serve in the army. Head of the Academy is Captain Juan Tassis, a strict and disciplined army veteran who wants to prepare the next generation for the next war."

  mexico.8.t:0 "Jacobin Assasinated"
  mexico.8.d:0 "Much uproar in the port city of Puerto Vallarta today. Because last night influential Jacobin politician Daniel Pardo was assassinated in a bar after getting drunk and getting into a heated argument with some conservative gentlemen about the California Republic. Daniel Pardo believed Mexico and California should unify under the control of Zapatista peacefully. Which the also drunk conservatives highly disagreed with and argued instead that the two nations should go to war once more and unify under the stronger rule of Mexico. After a small brawl one of the gentlemen shot the Jacobin and fled the scene.\nThe killer has not been caught but the police have talked to some of his friends who were there when the murder occured.Daniel Pardo will be buried in his family’s grave in his home town of Colima."

  mexico.9.t:0 "The December Reforms"
  mexico.9.d:0 "Now with the harsh summer and rainy fall behind us, we head swiftly into the winter. During which the government has announced several reforms, dubbed the December Reforms.\nThey will be aimed at stopping corruption on the local level by having a different government official every 2 months, which is to stop bribing, check the finances and policies of the local government, and when there is anything off it will be shown to the central government who will investigate the matter. Also in the reforms are included a prolonged police academy program. First to become a police officer you would have to be in the academy for 3 years, this has now been upped to 5 years. Together with this comes a renewed fight against bandits in the countryside who oppress many innocent people yearly. Many say this is the beginning of what good is to come for the people of Mexico. Not everyone is onboard, but virtually everyone is happy that at least something is being done."
  mexico.9.a:0 "Finally Some Good News!"

  mexico.10.t:0 "Introduction Of The Acto De Cerveza"
  mexico.10.d:0 "Although the December reforms have done a great deal for the people and for the country, the government has noted that during that same December period there is something else they would have liked to have tackled.\n They wish to limit the use of alcohol, as many studies and eye witness accounts have noted that it leads to more domestic abuse and of more arrests of young people, who then get a criminal record and may be unable to get a job.\nThus the government has chosen to put a ban on the sale or production of liquor, beer and other sorts of alcoholic drink anywhere. Although it is not illegal to drink or own it, it is now illegal to buy it. And if the police find out someone is selling or buying anything, they will fine those people heavily.\nSome of the more reformist groups find this change to be good and will mean that the Mexican people are no longer distracted by such useless matters as alcohol. On the other hand, the public isn’t so keen on the idea. They do agree that the things mentioned above are indeed issues needing to be dealt with, but maybe not this way."
  mexico.10.a:0 "It May Help!"

  mexico.11.t:0 "The Alcohol Riots"
  mexico.11.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the Acto De Cerveza Law, many pub, cafe and alcoholic drink factory owners have begun to riot. They are rioting because the law has virtually bankrupted them as for most of them, alcohol sale was the primary source of income. Now that they can’t sell it, their businesses are either useless or making such less income they are unable to pay rent or the owner unable to pay workers or for his own food. Their demands are simple, the Acto De Cerveza must go. But the government won’t submit, and instead offered concessions and subsidies to the protestors. But this won’t be enough. I guess we’ll have to see where this goes."
  mexico.11.a:0 "Maybe It Wasn't Such A Good Idea?"

  mexico.12.t:0 "The Booze Killer"
  mexico.12.d:0 "Darkness looms in the streets of Mexico City. Police have dubbed him ‘The Booze Killer’. A few people have been arrested, but none have been the killer, as the murdering spree kept going after the arrests. The unsuccessful capture of the killer has caused several police officers to be fired.\nHe or she is called ‘The Booze Killer’ because its motive for killing is apparently the Acto De Cerveza. It kills people not obeying the law. When it sees someone on the street drunk, with alcohol in their possession or both, it decides to wait not for god, but do the job himself. The identity of the killer is completely unknown to anyone, nor is it known whether it is the same person or a group of people and many wonder if it is even human."
  mexico.12.a:0 "Who Could This Be?"

  mexico.13.t:0 "Adressesing Increased Bandit Activity"
  mexico.13.d:0 "Police arrests are ramping up throughout the whole country these last few months. Mostly having to do with the illegal sale or production of beer and alcoholic drinks. It mostly seemed harmless till a certain point, which is when the police arrested a well known and wanted bandit leader. He was captured, alongside some workers, in what was assumed to be an abandoned mine producing illegal beer.\nAfter his capture the police began to wonder whether any of the other big bandit gangs in Mexico might be involved in this whole alcohol crisis. Their suspicions were confirmed when the arrests started piling up again, which again included various members of various bandit gangs. With this revelation, the government has become rather worried about the safety of the citizens and the stability of the nation. They’re unsure of what their next plan of action should be."

 # mexico.14.t:0 "Government Rumours"
 # mexico.14.d:0 "Many rumours have been going around between government officials about the Acto De Cerveza. Some have been about whether it was even a good idea, some about the recent bandit activity surrounding the law, but most are speaking of a possible reform or abolition of the law. But sadly nothing has been confirmed and protests are still ongoing in the streets of multiple Mexican cities. What will be done?"
 # mexico.14.a:0 "What Will Happen Next?"

  mexico.15.t:0 "Acto De Cerveza Reforms"
  mexico.15.d:0 "The decision is final. The Acto De Cerveza shall be reformed, not abolished, reformed. And it seems it will be done in a way to make most people happy. The changes are clear. The sale of alcoholic drinks is technically still illegal, but can now be bought in government owned stores. The beer production companies are allowed to produce it again if they get a deal with the government. Prices will also be set by the government on a national level. There is also good news for the cafe and pub owners, they can sell alcohol with the permission of the local government alcohol store, which will be where they get their alcohol for a lower price, after which they can sell it again for the national price. They are also only allowed to sell it from 19:00 in the evening to 3:00 in the night.\nBasically everyone is happy with this change, because it ensures that people can still drink their favourite beer, reduce bandit activity and still cut down on alcohol use and abuse. A real step in the right direction many have said."

  mexico.16.t:0 "Heat Wave Of '34"
  mexico.16.d:0 "Many people this summer found themselves essentially drying up. There was a massive crop failure in the entire north of the country thus resulting in a semi-famine in the north until they were resupplied by farms from the south. It was a critical situation for anyone to be in. Many people temporarily or permanently moved to live with family in the south. But even there at times the heat was unbearable.\nAll this heat caused some political instability in the central government, who were ineffective in dealing with the semi-famine and water problems in the north country. This meant that many people had to suffer because of incompetent bureacracy. This is certainly not a good image for the government."
  mexico.16.a:0 "Damn It's Hot!"

  mexico.17.t:0 "Durango Water Company"
  mexico.17.d:0 "After the terrible catastrophe that was the summer, the government has decided to take major measures to ensure it can never happen again. They have launched the Durango Water Company, a semi-independent company funded by the government.\nThis company has practically all the rights to water in Mexico, and is allowed to build filtration stations, canals to redirect water currents and pipelines to supply people in other areas. And when something like the heat wave should occur again, this company will make the decisions on how to deal with it effectively without having to wait for orders from the tops of the national government. Some people are worried about the power this company will gain over the water supply, but the government said not to worry as they will keep a very close eye on anything this company does, plus the fact that for large scale projects they’ll need government permits and funds, which they can’t gain without the government looking into the project. This does spark some hope."

  mexico.18.d:0 "Although the December Reforms had been relatively successful at eliminating corruption at the smaller scale across the country, corruption on the higher levels was never addressed. Until now. Recently a worker from the ministry of finance had been accused of taking bribes from the bandits near Mexico City and leaking certain classified documents to them. When the higher ups heard of this news, they were furious. Next week he is being tried in the court of Mexico City. Everyone knew there was corruption, but didn’t think it was this bad."

  mexico.19.t:0 "War On The Bandits"
  mexico.19.d:0 "It is official. The government is fed up. In a message in the press the government stated that the bandits have crossed the final line. They have now officially declared war on the bandits. Meaning that they will do everything in their power to fight these drunk scum, backwards terrorists and corrupt monsters. Included with the declaration of war was a renewed budget for the police, army and border garrisons. From now on every person crossing any border will be checked, no more loose ends. The police will also more easily be able to intrude on people’s privacy and private property. This was slightly worrying to the population, who haven’t been calmed yet. The government is hoping that with the combination of all these measures that eventually some time soon, Mexico will be beridden of these horrors."

  mexico.20.d:0 "Drugs, booze and psychedelic moods. La Banda Di Neptuno has it all. La Banda Di Neptuno or The Band From Neptune, is an up and coming Mexican band who mostly play in clubs or festivals. They are all the rage with the kids, who think the band's music makes them feel free and makes them think about themselves and life more thoroughly. This new found freedom has inspired many teens to start writing their own lyrics or create their own music. They are also liked very much for their deep meaning lyrics, though most of the older folk will blame this on the drugs. The psychedelia and avant-garde feels of the band have attracted many people to go to their concerts and buy their records. They have announced a tour of all of Mexico, and are happy with all the attention. The band has also stated that with the newfound funds they want to innovate even more on future records. Some say this is the beginning of a new era for music and others are more sceptical. Whatever you might think about them, they are staying."

  mexico.21.d:0 "It was a cold night, about 3 degrees celsius. Wasn’t much going on around here. The lights were out at Villa De Cristal. They had no idea what was coming.\n‘Are you ready to move in Squad 1? Over’\n’We are ready to move in Commander. Over’\n’Good Squad 1, move in on my command. Over’\n’Alright, move in Squad 1!’\nThe doors busted open with a loud bang as the troops of squad 1 moved in to secure the villa. The gangsters, overwhelmed by the troops either took cover, were shot or started shooting back. It was a real shooting fest.\nThen everything calmed down. Was everyone dead? No, quite the contrary. It seems squad 1 had come out victorious, with only losing 1 troop.\nThey quickly arrested any remaining gangsters and started to secure the rest of the villa. The rooms were either empty or ravaged with bullets. That was until they made it to the garage. Cocaine, cocaine everywhere. Must have been about 500 kilos of pure cocaine. All neatly packed and ready for shipping. A victory for the government."

  mexico.22.t:0 "The Veracruz Arrests"
  mexico.22.d:0 "A cargo ship arrived in the Veracruz harbour this morning. It had cargo from several locations, including Germany, British West Africa and Gran Colombia. After the government declared ‘war’ on the bandits, they invested heavily into training military personnel to keep an eye on imports in the biggest harbours. So when a bandit member tried to bribe a dock worker to smuggle drugs into Mexico, he did not oblige and instead called up the on duty military personnel to deal with it. Although something like this has happened before, this time for some reason the person who tried to bribe the dock worker wasn’t alone. He was with some influential members of the Morata bandit gang. They were all subsequently arrested and will be put on trial. Whether the influential members were set up by the Marata bandit leader is unknown, but it might have been a way for him to get rid of powerful figures and non-trustworthy members, though this is still up to investigation. About 500 million pesos worth of drugs have been seized and destroyed. After it hit the news, many people congratulated the government on their good job."

  mexico.23.t:0 "Bandit Leader Captured"
  mexico.23.d:0 "After the arrests of Oscar Marato, Victor Marato and their lawyer Antonio Zaragoza in Veracruz not too long ago, the police launched an official investigation into why they were present at the deal. The question has already finished up, and the convicts are willing to give up some information about the head of the Marato bandit gang. They are also willing to give the location of the headquarters of the bandits for a shorter prison sentence. The government accepted the deal and had started an operation. The operation took place last night, with big success. The head of the bandit gang, Sergi Marato and other influential members have been arrested and put into jail. The bandit gang was mostly situated throughout the state of Sonora and had bribed many policemen to keep it a secret. This arrest has to be one of the biggest hits to the Mexican and Colombian bandits."

  mexico.26.d:0 "Have you seen this man? White, brunette, about 5’9 and wearing particularly odd clothing. His odd clothing was described as modern or new, looked out of place and kind of like something the British would make. And he seemed to be carrying some sort of small box with colours on it. Appeared outta nowhere in the middle of Tucson a few days ago. He went to a bar and asked for a man named Juba. No one knew who the man was looking for exactly. After asking why the man needed to see this ‘Juba’, the man answered by showing a letter he got from Juba. Showing a date and time which happened to be today on that day. Nuthin unusual till you notice that with the date included is a year, which would surely be unnecessary for any normal letter. The man disappeared after that, causing a bit of trouble when he tried to cook some meat in his hotel room and burned the carpet. He fled quickly from the scene. The police are still clueless about the man's whereabouts and identity, all we have to go off is a small note that fell out of his pocket which said the words ‘stin bode chkpon’, with a bunch of white bits between the letter. Nobody knows what it means."

  mexico.27.t:0 "Trial Of Damián Rouco"
  mexico.27.d:0 "Last July, late at night in a bar in Tampico, 3 bodies were found by a lady working in the back of the bar. She discovered the bodies after hearing some kerfuffle coming from the main saloon hall. She sadly wasn’t able to see the criminal, nor his getaway. In the bar when she entered was also another man, who said he was robbing the register. They quickly called the cops who arrived to question them.\n\nAfter some talking with the cops, it was decided to launch an official investigation into the case. However while they were talking, one of the men who was shot made some noise, and it turned out one of them hadn’t died. He was rushed to the hospital, and being able to barely see was asked to point to someone who vaguely looked like the culprit.\n\nMeanwhile on the other side of town, Damián Rouco had just arrived to fight in a boxing match against Jose Manuell Sallent. Damián Rouco is a black boxer who lives in San Luis Potosí and is close to getting a spot in the national boxing championship.\n\nA few days later when the case was made more public, a man stepped forward with some info, Victor Balderas. He claimed to have seen the culprits drive away from the bar with San Luis Potosí licence plates. And thus the police investigated the whole town for people from that region, and found Damián Rouco’s car.\n\nDamián Rouco matched the description given by the wounded man, Victor Balderas and several other witnesses who came forward. Although Damián was at the time of the crime with some friends in a restaurant, no one from the restaurant has confirmed this and the police believes those friends were most likely fellow culprits. Thus Damián was arrested, with his friends nowhere to be seen. Seeing as the evidence wasn’t fully solid, he was put on a trial. And after a very tense trial, in which his race and boxing skills were brought in as evidence against him, he was sentenced to death for a double homicide. Whether it was a fair trial is still and will always be up for debate."
