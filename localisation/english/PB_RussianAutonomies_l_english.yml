  PB_BAL_Denikin_Playground:0 "Denikin's Playground"
  PB_BAL_Denikin_Playground_desc:0 "The horrors that occur in the Baltic Governate cannot be described with words. The souls that inhabit the region are broken beyond repair, Denikin and his grunts abuse their power on levels even Moscow would blink an eye at. Yet the Tsar is complacent, afterall Denikin is effective at his job; silencing any opposition that can be found in the Baltics.\n\nBeing the most Russified Governate of all of Russia's autonomies the Baltic people know their time for 'nominal' independence is soon to be over. New Russian communities have already largely replaced urban centers and the only areas that still house a majority ethnic baltic population are undeveloped rural towns."
  PB_FIN_Winter_War:0 "The Winter War"
  PB_FIN_Winter_War_desc:0 "The Finnish revolt of 1931 has been a thorn in Russia's administrative efforts in controlling the region, officially governed by the Russian Empire in reality the northern regions are effectively under the command of rag-tag Finnish seperatists. That and their continued support from Scandanavian nations, namely Sweden, has pro-longed this 'winter' guerilla campaign longer than expected. Tank combat is rendered effectively useless because of Finlands terrain with Russian tactics now boiling down to 'send as many men as we can' to drive the Free Finnish Army out. With already 5,000 Russian deaths compared to a measly 300 Finnish deaths the demands for peace become louder in Moscow."
  PB_FIN_Scandinavian_Support:0 "Scandinavian Support"
  PB_FIN_Scandinavian_Support_desc:0 "The military support the Free Finnish Army recieves from Sweden is vital to their secessionist cause. In fact almost all Finnish weapons are of Swedish origin with only a hand full of weapons being produced locally, if funding was to be some how cut then Finland as a concept would die within a heart beat. Sweden and the rest of Scandanavia provide Finland with military know-how in the form of secret attaches, of course the Scandanavian nations are mostly sending military proffesionals in the hopes of improving their own army, and not out of the goodness of their hearts. Although all can agree it would be better if Russia wasn't knocking on their doorstep."
  PB_ASK_Political_Melting_Pot:0 "Liberty on Ice"
  PB_ASK_Political_Melting_Pot_desc:0 "Russian America has always been a state on the periphery of the Empire, often neglected in favor of Russia’s concerns in Europe. That same neglect would lead to Alaska becoming a strange little democratic slice of the Empire, even in the years before the liberalizations. With St. Petersburg often concerned with other issues, Alaska was afforded significant autonomy to manage its’ own affairs. Coupled with the population intermarrying with native Alaskans and cultural exchange with the untamed West, Alaska quickly became the first testbed of the modern Russian democratic experiment, even if it didn’t quite know it at the time.\n\nRussia’s American colonies would be reorganized in the late 1800s into the United Colonies of Russian America, being granted the right to maintain a Duma independent of the Empire’s legislature. While officially the American Duma is subservient to the Tsar and St. Petersburg, in truth the remote nature of the colony makes enforcing any dictates difficult."
  PB_RUS_Alaskan_Oil:0 "Black Gold Rush"
  PB_RUS_Alaskan_Oil_desc:0 "The Alaskan State Oil Concern was established following the discovery of the Vilkitsky Oil Basin in 1927, one of the largest oil deposits in North America. The remote nature of the basin has made exporting the oil in meaningful amounts difficult, but it has nonetheless sparked an intense infrastructure boom by local companies and megacorporations like Union Standard Oil. The “race to the sea” as it is called has supercharged Alaska’s economy, though the lack of a large single pipeline network has remained a limiting factor.\n\nComplicating matters is Russian America’s status within the Empire. Neither independent nor an integrated province, the United Colonies occupy a legal gray area within the Russian imperial system that has raised tensions between the two countries. Russia seeks to exploit Alaskan oil exports, levying tariffs and limiting buyers to those outside the Anglo-American market. The United Colonies have chaffed under these limitations, but their ambiguous legal status within the Russian Empire has left little effective recourse beyond protest and traitorous discussions of independence."
  PB_ASK_Prison_State:0 "Prison State"
  PB_ASK_Prison_State_desc:0 "Established in 1899, the Aleutian Islands Correctional Sector was created to house and rehabilitate the most dangerous prisoners of the Russian correctional system. The location made escape nearly impossible and, more importantly, made oversight practically nonexistent. Even during the liberalizations, the island was used for the housing of political dissidents more than actual criminals. During and after the Great War, the island was used to house anti-war activists, though new prisoner shipments were suspended until the defeat of the Japanese Navy.\n\nBy 1933, the Correctional Sector’s importance has grown alongside its’ population. Thousands of ethnic nationalists were deported to the facility following the Nationalist Rebellions of the 1920s, along with many far-left agitators and Russian Jews.\n\nThe primary housing facility is located on the island of Unalaska, with secondary housing and industrial sites scattered across the islands. Inmates live under the constant watch of vast panopticons, with the only chance at freedom being the prospect of a work lease to nearby Russian America as a manual laborer."
  PB_ASK_Exile_Nation:0 "A Nation of Exiles"
  PB_ASK_Exile_Nation_desc:0 "Alaska’s distance from the control of St. Petersburg hasn’t just given ethnic Russians a looser leash, but also several minority groups who migrated or were deported to the region. Alaska maintains a significant minority of Ukrainians, Chechens, Poles, Balts, and Circassians alongside their own Native Alaskan minorities. The first wave of immigration was largely Circassians and Caucasian Muslims, deported as far East as possible when not massacred outright during the “Pacification” of the Caucasus in the late 1700s. Additional waves came with the Nationalist Rebellions, which saw many independence leaders forced to flee the Russian Empire or face the noose.\n\nA great many of these figures fled to Russian America, far enough from the reach of the Okhrana to avoid capture if they laid low. As tensions between Russia and their wayward colony became more apparent, the Alaskan Duma has been more and more content with letting these exile groups operate openly, creating a vibrant community of expatriates that have begun to agitate for their brethren at home."
  
  PB_BAL_Forest_Brothers:0 "Forest Brothers"
  PB_BAL_Forest_Brothers_desc:0 "With Denikin's goons targeting ethnic Balts and German minorities it has come to no surprise to Moscow that resitance groups have formed to counter the Russian funded savages. Nicknamed the Forest Brothers, the resistance group is mainly made up of Ethnic balts, the majority of which are Estonian. Acting as a sort of peoples militia that respond to calls for help the Forest Brothers are an effective and ready partisan group and remain as the only armed presence that can counter Denikin's roaming hit squads."
  PB_TRS_Caucasus_Resorts:0 "Resorts In Caucasia"
  PB_TRS_Caucasus_Resorts_desc:0 "The resorts that can be found in Caucasia are nothing short of amazing. Every year during the summer months thousands of rich aristocrats and business men vacate to the Caucasus to find time to breathe and relax. Here anything from prostitution to mind-bending drugs can be found and no one blinks an eye. Moscow knows of the situation but the profits that are made in the summer months are too good to missout on. "
  PB_PGA_Galician_Occupation:0 "The Forever War"
  PB_PGA_Galician_Occupation_desc:0 "Galicia has been under occupation for nearly a decade. The region was, prior to the Nationalist Rebellions, a part of the internal autonomous region of Russian Poland. After the rebellions, however, Galicia was seized from the newly formed Autonomous Polish Kingdom and directly occupied by the Russian Army. The principal reason behind the continued occupation is the Hungarian border, as during the rebellions Hungary’s degenerate revolutionary government aided Polish and Ukrainian rebels through the temporarily undefended border.\n\nThe occupation has achieved its’ strategic goals but has consistently failed to find any sort of long-term solution to the future of the region. Polish irredentists seek reunification with Galicia and dream of Greater Poland, while Russian intelligence fears that restoring Galicia to Polish rule will open the floodgates for another rebellion.\n\nIn 1932, St. Petersburg allowed the formation of the Galician Duma, effectively a rubber stamp organization that could put a better face on the occupation. Though it remains a functional police state, the Galician Duma at least provides the veneer of a democratic process."
