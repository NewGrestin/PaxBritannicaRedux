## -------- Names and Descriptions -------- ##
 megacorp_edison_imperial_electric_company: "Edison Imperial Electric Company"
 megacorp_edison_imperial_electric_company_desc: "§CEdison Imperial Electric Company§! was founded in 1880 as Edison Industries in London, as part of an electrification incentivization program. While initially only concerned with electrification, Edison grew throughout the Second Renaissance to control vast portions of the British Empire's wireless infrastructure.\n\nOver time, the company diversified into various other fields, establishing the Edison Armworks and Edison Medical subsidiaries in the early 1900s. As of 1933, the EIEC is the largest corporate entity on the planet, rivaled only by Tesla Electriworks. It commands whole industries, ranging from mining and manufacturing to medicine and munitions.\n\nAt one time, Edison Electric was simply the power company, but today that term takes on an §Rentirely new meaning§!."
 megacorp_tesla_electricworks: "Tesla Electricworks"
 megacorp_tesla_electricworks_desc: "§GTesla Electricworks§! was founded in 1897 in Moscow by Nikola Tesla, with subsidies from the government of the Russian Empire. The answer to the Anglo-American Edison Corporation, Tesla Electricworks served as Russia's primary infrastructure and armaments developer throughout the Second Renaissance. Most notably, Tesla Electricworks would pioneer the concept of Teleforce and Arc Thrower weaponry, the latter of which would be a critical part of Russia's Great War military doctrine.\n\nAfter Nikola Tesla's disappearence from public life, de-facto control of the company was handed to the Board of Directors in 1925. While Tesla maintains significant shares in Electricworks, he has been unwilling to interact with the company outside the occasional telegram or carrier pigeon.\n\nAs of 1933, Tesla Electricworks has expanded to be the leading infrastructure and armaments company of the Russian sphere, as well as limited investments in the Balkans and the Middle East."
 megacorp_imperial_fruit: "Anglo-American Imperial Fruit Company"
 megacorp_imperial_fruit_desc: "The §OAnglo-American Imperial Fruit Company§! was established in 1851 via the consolidation of various fruit and agricultural concerns in the British Empire. One of the first Imperial Corporations, IFC is the world's largest producer and distributor of fruit, vegetable and organic substitute products.\n\nThe IFC holds a near undisputed monopoly over Cental America, where its' influence is acutely felt by any government that rocks the boat a bit too much. Since 1860, the IFC has additionally gone on to establish controlling stakes in the former Brazilian states and the Andes Federation, granting it near dictatorial influence over the Post-Brazilian interior."
 megacorp_standard_oil: "Union Standard Oil Company"
 megacorp_standard_oil_desc: "The §RUnion Standard Oil Company§! was founded in 1870 by John D. Rockefeller in the province of Ohio, in the United Commonwealth. A precursor to Edison Electric, Standard Oil was the model upon which many future Megacorporations would follow. Unlike many companies of the time, Standard Oil controlled the entire logistics line of their products, cutting out excess costs by managing every stage of their interests.\n\nWhile not nearly as influential in the United Commonwealth as the EIEC, Standard Oil maintains a symbiotic relationship with Edison by virtue of their dominance in Oil extraction. Oil and oil products continue to be the dominant means of energy production in the first world, and thus the EIEC and Standard Oil remain begrudging partners."
 megacorp_carnegie_steel_company: "Carnegie Steel Company"
 megacorp_carnegie_steel_company_desc: "The §BCarnegie Steel Company§! was established in 1892 by Andrew Carnegie, and quickly grew to become a major corporate entity during the Second Renaissance. The company would be most notable for their lifted steel processes, which would revolutionize construction and manufacturing, paving the way for the modern megaplexes of the first world.\n\nCarnegie Steel would also play a pivotal role in the Green Sahara Project, of which Andrew Carnegie was a significant donor. Carnegie Steel would be the skeleton upon which New Alexandria was built, and Carnegie himself would supposedly lobby to have the new Commonwealth named after himself, although his estate claims that Carnegie originally refused the title.\n\nCarnegie Steel would find a new home in the developing world and now resides primarily in Carnegia, where lifted steel is now used to bring the dark continent into the modern industrial future."
 megacorp_zaibatsu_exiles: "Exiled Japanese Zaibatsu"
 megacorp_zaibatsu_exiles_desc: "Prior to the Japanese Revolution, §YZaibatsu§! was a term used to refer to industrial and financial conglomerates in Imperial Japan. The largest of these groups were Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Yasuda, some of which could trace their lineage back to the Japanese Edo period.\n\nAs the Japanese Empire went up in flames, many of these conglomerates chose to flee into exile wherever they could. Most would simply migrate to the Korean Empire, where they quickly found a financial base among wealthy Japanese emigres. Korea's infrastructure was demolished by the Great War, and thus began the so-called Second Colonization, as Korea found itself divided by Russian and Japanese interests once more.\n\nZaibatsu continue to be a prevalent economic force in the Pacific, with influence reaching as far as the American West Coast and Hawaii. While they remain one of the lesser Megacorporate forces, they still hold enough influence to justifiably be labeled as such."
 megacorp_debeers: "Beit Diamond Mining and Extraction Corporation"
 megacorp_debeers_desc: "§PBeit Diamond Mining and Extraction Corporation§! was established in 1887 by Alfred Beit, a German gold and diamond magnate from Hamburg. The company would primarily be focused on the South African Diamond Belt, encompassing the Cape Colony republics of Goshen and the Orange Free State. Secondary concerns would be established in German Central Africa and Portuguese Africa, prior to the latter becoming the home of the Portuguese monarchy.\n\nThe Beit Corporation would become the primary rival of the IACA, as both battled for control of Africa's many resources. In many cases, these battles would be quite literal, as both sides maintain large mercenary forces drawn from across the globe. Beit's principle concerns lie in Southern Africa, where it uses a combination of corporate power, slave labor and forced augmentation to squeeze diamonds from Africa, ethical quandaries be damned."
 megacorp_big_three: "Big Three"
 megacorp_big_three_desc: "The §YBig Three§! is a term used in reference to the combined monopolies of the British Coal and Steel Company, the British Tea and Coffee Manufacturing Concern and the Asian Opium industries. These companies predominantly control Britain's Indian colonies and protectorates, with interests in Insulindia and China.\n\nBritish Coal and Steel functions as the primary resource extraction corporation of these regions, while British Tea and Coffee serves as the primary cash crop producer. These companies primarily rely on lax colonial labor laws, allowing them to effectively enforce indentured servitude on their employees. Augmentation legislation is similarly lax, in extreme cases allowing the companies to mandate workers be given life altering augmentations to improve their output.\n\nLess official are the Opium industries, which while technically illegal in many nations are nonetheless a major arm of British power in Asia. Opium is heavily traded in the Golden Triangle, the region shared between Siam, Indochina and Burma. This area allows for transport into China, which continues to be one of the world's largest opium importers."
 megacorp_africa_association: "International Association for the Civilization of Africa"
 megacorp_africa_association_desc: "The §rInternational Association for the Civilization of Africa§! was formed in 1885 as, officially, a private charity venture to promote literacy and European culture in Africa. The IACA spreads Christianity through missionaries, builds infrastructure, and helps to bring the African peoples the best that Europe can offer.\n\nThis is, of course, a lie.\n\nIn truth, the IACA is the largest corporate entity on the African continent, lead by a board of directors based out of Europe. Using their economic power and European backing, the IACA has managed to establish an empire of their own in Africa. Smuggling, blood diamonds, war profiteering, prostitution, and ivory trading are the least of the IACA's crimes. While Europe falls back into armed military camps, the Association is content to act with near legal impunity in a blind spot of the world, bringing unimaginable suffering in the process.\n\nEven among typically amoral megacorporations, the Association remains one of the most reviled open secrets of the global economic system."
