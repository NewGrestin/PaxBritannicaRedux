  nuclear.1.t:0 "Atomic Bombing"
  nuclear.1.d:0 "One of our nation's provinces has been struck by an atomic bombing. Unprecedented in history, this type of bombing has been catastrophic for the affected area. Much of the targeted province has been decimated, killing thousands and leaving thousands more homeless. Even worse, those who have survived are suffering from intense illness and third degree burns. Medical personnel are stretched thin trying to handle the mass influx of sick and injured, while rescuers are having difficulty moving through the ruins to find survivors.\n\nTo say the attack is a major disaster would be an understatement. It will take years to recover from just this attack alone."
  nuclear.1.a:0 "Oh."

  chembio.1.t:0 "Chemical Leak!"
  chembio.1.d:0 "Our ongoing research on weaponizing certain chemical agents has resulted in a leak! One of our chemical weapons facilities suffered major casualties after a chemical reaction caused an explosion, killing several scientists and allowing noxious gases to spill into several sectors.\n\nThough the leak has been contained, several members of the research team are dead or will be hospitalized for some time."
  chembio.1.a:0 "Terrible!"

  chembio.2.t:0 "Disease Outbreak"
  chembio.2.d:0 "Our ongoing research on weaponizing certain biological agents has resulted in a minor disease outbreak!\n\nOne of our facilities has experienced an outbreak of illness due to carelessness in quarantine, resulting in several deaths and hospitalizations. We have urged our scientists to be more careful in the future, as further outbreaks may have catastrophic consequences."
  chembio.2.a:0 "We should be more careful"

  chembio.3.t:0 "Enemy Biological Attack"
  chembio.3.d:0 "Our soldiers at the front are suddenly falling ill after a series of enemy attacks. Upon investigation, it appears the illness is being caused by a weaponized illness deployed by one of our enemies against us.\n\nWe've quarantined the affected soldiers, but it may not be enough to keep this illness from spreading beyond the affected frontline or to our neighbors."
  chembio.3.a:0 "Oh no."

  chembio.4.t:0 "Enemy Chemical Attack"
  chembio.4.d:0 "In an effort to affect the ongoing battle on the frontline, our enemy has deployed chemical weapons against our forces!"
  chembio.4.a:0 "Oh no."

  chembio.5.t:0 "Reports of Mass Infections"
  chembio.5.d:0 "The deployment of biological weapons in our neighbors has gotten out of hand. We've begun to receive reports from throughout the nation of people coming down ill, with many requiring hospitalization. Whatever engineered nightmare our neighbors have been afflicted with has spread to our own homeland.\n\nFor the time being, we've quarantined the worst affected areas but the illness will likely persist for some time. Instances of rioting and looting in affected areas are not entirely uncommon and will be handled to the best of our ability. As it stands right now, the best we can do is hunker down and hope to ride out the storm."
  chembio.5.a:0 "Get this under control!"

  chembio.6.t:0 "Biological Weapons Outbreak Escalates"
  chembio.6.d:0 "Following a recent attack by our enemy with biological weapons, we've begun to receive reports of outbreaks within the civilian population. With the currently ongoing conflicts in our nation, efforts to contain the spread have been disrupted, and the disease now threatens to spread across the border into neighboring countries."
  chembio.6.a:0 "Oh shit."

  chembio.7.t:0 "Enemy Biological Attack"
  chembio.7.d:0 "Our soldiers at the front are suddenly falling ill after a series of enemy attacks. Upon investigation, it appears the illness is being caused by a weaponized illness deployed by one of our enemies against us.\n\nWe've quarantined the affected soldiers, but it may not be enough to keep this illness from spreading beyond the affected frontline or to our neighbors."
  chembio.7.a:0 "Oh no."

  chembio.8.t:0 "Enemy Livewire Shelling"
  chembio.8.d:0 "Our troops on the frontline are reporting a sudden outbreak of Livewire, likely caused by the enemy shelling Livewire buds on the region. Until this situation is resolved, we will be forced to advance more slowly to avoid casualties. On the upside, the enemy will have to deal with this issue as well."
  chembio.8.a:0 "Get the flamethrower."

  PB_WMD_Decisions_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great War introduced the world to many new and destructive weapons, most notably chemical weaponry. In the time since, there have been significant advancements in the development of various weapons of mass destruction. Researching and developing these weapons could give us a significant edge in future conflicts, although the ethical ramifications of developing such implements are questionable at best."

Effectively creating a form of Substance-Induced Psychosis, the mixture easily causes disruptions in military operations by effectively turning personnel against one another. The Induced Psychosis, in turn, can cause individuals to resort to incredible violence against one another. The lack of discretion caused by the compound can lead to rioting, inter-family violence, and in extreme cases even cannibalism and autocannibalism."
