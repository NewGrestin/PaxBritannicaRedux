   FFI_Aarne_Sihvo_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 22/11/1889\n\n§YAarne Sihvo§! has been fighting for Finland independence since 1907. Joining the French Chasseur Units, created in France with the intention to support Finnish Partisans against Russia, with the very young age of 18. Throughout the war he would undergo military training, see forestry combat in Hessen and helping to find new member in Finland. With French defeat in 1910 becoming definitive, Sihvo and the Chasseur's would return to Finland and go underground. Rather then promptly attacking Russians, the organization would keep waiting, growing their numbers and finding new sources of support without catching the firely glare of Moscow. In 1919 Sihvo would be arrested for his activities and be put into the Petersburg Prison. In 1921 he would escape and flee to Germany where he would find suprising amount of sympathy and actual support from certain key players for the struggle of the Finnish people. Later on he would establish important contacts in the Swedish Army and Industry which would become the greatest source of support for the upcoming struggle. When the National Revolutions of the late 20s in the Russian realm began Sihvo would wait some months before attacking the Russians hoping that Russian garrisons would be reduced to quell the other rebellions. When the Chasseur's finally entered the fray, his strategy pulled off extremely well. Several cities were completetly overwhelmed and in just a weeks the Russians lost most parts of the country. However Sihvo knew that he could not fight the Russians in open combat and used the time to gain to strengthen his numbers and convince several Finnish Generals to switch their loyalties and help their cause. Throughout the last years, the Finnish have been fighting in every forest a Russian would step his feet in and pulled of one of the most effective guerilla campaigns to date. The North now lies in completete control of the Finnish.Now in 1933 the Russians want to end the rebellion once and for all with a large upcoming offensive to retake the north.\n\n§YWill Sihvo be one of Finlands greatest heroes? Or will he be their last martyr?§!"

   
   FIN_Eino_Rahja_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 20/06/1885\n\n§YEino Rahja§! is a man without any friend. He was born in Northern Finland to a Finnish Family and in 1903 started working in Petersburg as a factory worker. With war breaking out between Russia and Japan, Rahja joins the Russian armed forces in the East and quickly advances through the ranks. However most of his achievements were not seen on the front but rather behind closed doors. Loyalty is often more rewarded then competence. With the national revolutions of the 20s breaking out, Eino is send to Finland his home country to prove his loyalty to Moscow where he was able to largely subdue the small rebelling groups. Eino suddenly gained a great reputation within the Russian elite as Finnish Weak Resistance compared to other national rebellions was largely contributed to his work. Rahja would use this short period in Moscow to finally experience life to his fullest, enjoying the newest gene-drugs and becoming fat. However this period of his life would not last for long as the real rebellion in Finland broke out only 2 years later. Rahja the great architect of the last subjugation was send to finish the job again but this time, the tides had changed.\n\nThe Finnish Rebellion was far more organized then last time and conducted guerilla warfare far better. While Rahja was able to regain the cities of the South, he could not prevent the formation of large Free Finnish Army in the North. For 2 years now Rahja's Finnish and Russian forces have been desperatetly trying to regain their control of the north without success. Though you can not call the Russian Army in Finland under his control anymore. With defeat after defeat, Eino has increasingly retreated himself to Helsinki from where administers the rest of the country. Falling more and more into alcoholism he loses all his remaining friends and allies. The only ones he has left are his criminial smuggling network and the Finnish Jacobin Front he increasingly aids to combat Chasseur rebels.\n\n§YEino Rahja times are over. The only interesting thing about him, is the question how he will die?§!"

  ffinland.10.d:0 "A delegation by the Free Finnish Resistance has arrived in Frankfurt petitioning for support in their war of indepedence against Russia.\n\nThe German Government remains firm on their decision to not militarily support the nationalistic rebellions in East. However the German People are very sympathetic towards the struggles of the Finnish people and many call to atleast send minimal support to the Fins.\n\nThe government is now debating to send classified humanitarian aid to the North. The support package would improve the Finnish infrastructure, contain logistical support and 5000 helmets. The package would not be a drag on the German nation and be an easy way to support in a small but meaningful way."

  PB_FIN_Unpopular_Administration:0 "Unpopular Administration"
  PB_FIN_Unpopular_Administration_desc:0 "The intrusion of Russian affairs into Finland hasn't been met with positive reception. Whilst not unique to Finland as all Russia's autonomies wish for the bear to let go in Finlands case the situation is arguably worse due to the continued partisan campaign by the Free Finnish Army. The people know that there is hope for independence and it is because of this that they will do everything in their power to fight Moscow. Though there is a clear remedy to this issue, end the Finnish partisan threat and the people will in time loose hope."
  PB_FIN_Scandinavian_Support:0 "Scandinavian Support"
  PB_FIN_Scandinavian_Support_desc:0 "The military support the Free Finnish Army recieves from Sweden is vital to their secessionist cause. In fact almost all Finnish weapons are of Swedish origin with only a hand full of weapons being produced locally, if funding was to be some how cut then Finland as a concept would die within a heart beat. Sweden and the rest of Scandanavia provide Finland with military know-how in the form of secret attaches, of course the Scandanavian nations are mostly sending military proffesionals in the hopes of improving their own army, and not out of the goodness of their hearts. Although all can agree it would be better if Russia wasn't knocking on their doorstep."
  PB_FIN_Winter_War:0 "The Winter War"
  PB_FIN_Winter_War_desc:0 "The Finnish revolt of 1931 has been a thorn in Russia's administrative efforts in controlling the region, officially governed by the Russian Empire in reality the northern regions are effectively under the command of rag-tag Finnish seperatists. That and their continued support from Scandanavian nations, namely Sweden, has pro-longed this 'winter' guerilla campaign longer than expected. Tank combat is rendered effectively useless because of Finlands terrain with Russian tactics now boiling down to 'send as many men as we can' to drive the Free Finnish Army out. With already 5,000 Russian deaths compared to a measly 300 Finnish deaths the demands for peace become louder in Moscow."
