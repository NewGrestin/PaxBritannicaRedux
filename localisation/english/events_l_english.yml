 america.1.t:0 "The Dominion of America in 1936"
 america.1.d:0 "Since the establishment of British colonial authority in America, the region has been wracked with conflict and controversy. The Rebellion of centuries past brought a fundamental change in how the Crown approached governing her overseas territories. The Treaty of Philadelphia would mark the beginning British government’s “Home Rule” policy, granting Dominions the liberty in their internal affairs that they so desired. The Dominion of America is the very model of the Home Rule system. In the years since the First Great War, the American Dominion has found itself sitting atop the North American powder keg. Ultranationalist and socialist movements, emboldened by the revolutions of the 1920s, are quickly gaining steam in the upcoming General Elections. In the West, Mexico’s empire continues to crumble, threatened by Tacoman expansionism and internal strife. Aided by their northern sister nation of Canada, how the government in Philadelphia will handle the coming years remains to be seen..."
 america.1.a:0 "For King and Country!"
 america.4.t:0 "The Trial of the Century"
 america.4.d:0 "On January 18th, 1936, a German-American Carpenter by the name of Bruno Richard Hauptmann was executed by electric chair in the state of New Jersey for the kidnapping and murder of Charles A. Lindbergh Junior, son of famed aviator and Continental Congress Party leader Charles Lindbergh. On the night of March first, 1932, 20 month old Charles Linbergh Jr. was abducted from his home by Hauptmann, who accessed the second story room by a ladder. Hauptmann proceeded to leave a ransom note written in poor grammar demanding 50,000 Dollars. The body of Charles Lindbergh Jr. was found on May 12th near the home, it is still uncertain whether Hauptmann killed the child or accidently dropped him while descending the ladder. A lengthy investigation tied him in being there at the place and time, in possession of ransom money, and to have similar broken handwriting to that in the note. After a month long trial and almost a year of denied court appeals he was finally executed today, a short four years after the actual kidnapping."
 america.4.a:0 "Not everyone will agree with his politics but we can all agree justice has been served."

# LAKOTAN EVENTS
######################
 lakota.1.t:0 "The Lakota Confederation in 1936"
 lakota.1.d:0 "The Lakota Confederation was forged out of the Sioux tribes of the Upper Plains and a compromise between the Sioux, French, and British over a common border in the 1850's. With the only option being to join the Lakota Confederacy or to be wiped out by White Settlers, most of their independent tribal neighbors quickly joined in, regardless of the pre-existing divides between them. After a war over the Nez Perce lands in the Rockies with Tacoma and the annexation and repopulation of former Skitswish lands, it was proven the Lakota could hold their own against the colonists. As of now, the state is organized into a Tribal Council, with one representative from each tribe voting in a High Chief. However the oligarchic Council is under great controversy, with the Seven Sioux Tribes and their allies holding all of the voting power over the others, reform is demanded. However the Confederation is also plagued with other issues, ranging from long standing tribal disputes, Wovoka's preaching of the Ghost Dance to the Nomads, and the revanchist Tacoma along with its other unstable neighbors, the Confederation is in dire need for change, whether by popular choice or by an iron fist remains to be seen..."

#NORWAY EVENTS
######################
 norway.1.t:0 "The North Sea Defense Committee"
 norway.1.d:0 "A surprising proposal has arrived from the government in London. They have proposed the formation of a “North Sea Defense Board” to protect trade and promote common defense in the region. Formed of a committee between our many nations, this board seeks to ensure that the German armistice remains in check and that conflicts in Europe can be kept under control. Though some have their doubts about the efficacy of such a plan, it is hard to say that having an ally with Britain is unattractive."
 norway.1.a:0 "Of course."
 norway.1.b:0 "What? No."
 norway.101.t:0 "Denmark Names Norway Her Subject"
 norway.101.d:0 "Citing Denmark's past personal unions with Norway, and a growing Scandinavian nationalism across the peninsula, the Danish government has demanded that Norway become a subject of her southern neighbor."
 norway.101.a:0 "We don't have much of a choice, I suppose."
 norway.101.b:0 "We will not surrender our sovereignty."

 canada.1.t:0 "A Commonwealth of Equals"
 canada.1.d:0 "The British Commonwealth has always been relatively one-sided. The colonies and dominions work, and London reaps the rewards. This has been the status quo for more than a century. This, of course, makes the most recent proposal from London so shocking. The new Liberal government has proposed that the Commonwealth be based on mutual respect between comrades, rather than by imperial mandate. Capping off this idea is the proposed “London Congress” to draft a Commonwealth constitution by which all member states shall abide. Our advisors have highly urged us to send a delegation."

brazil.1.t:0 "The British Recognize our Nation"
brazil.1.d:0 "In a rather strange turn of events, the capitalist oppressors of London have chosen to recognize our glorious people’s government, something their previous administration had been unwilling to do. Looking into this further, it appears the British have elected a socialist, and not just any socialist, but a woman socialist. How strange to see one of the most traditionally reactionary nations in the world elect such a leader. This new administration may prove fruitful to our ongoing endeavor to bring the people’s revolution to all of South America."
brazil.1.a:0 "Quite Interesting"

# AUSTRIA EVENTS
######################
austria.1.t:0 "England seeks Accomodations with us."
austria.1.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, our historic enemies in England have taken to fascist thought. While some in our government believe that the English intend to backstab us, it appears that their intentions are pure. Having perfidious albion at our side in our future endeavors might prove useful. We should certainly consider this idea."
austria.1.a:0 "Let them in."
austria.1.b:0 "We will never cooperate with the English."
austria.2.t:0 "The 1937 Vienna Conference"
austria.2.d:0 "Members of the party have arrived from throughout the nation in Vienna for the 1937 Party Conference. The Conference has been held every year since the Front rose to power, and has been a key element in policy decisions. This year is unique, however. Formerly niche political blocks within the party have begun to gain traction. The Restorationists, headed by representatives of the Habsburg monarchy in exile, have come to propose their idea of a new Imperial state. On the opposite spectrum, the Strasserist block has come forward to push their own agenda, headed by Gregor Strasser. As the opening ceremonies of the conference are conducted, reporters from at home and abroad wait with baited breath to hear the news of the results."
austria.2.a:0 "Interesting"
austria.3.t:0 "The Habsburg Restoration"
austria.3.d:0 "In a shocking political upset, the Restorationist Block has taken control at the Vienna Conference. Representing the Habsburg monarchy in exile, the Restorationists have been unanimously voted into power by the Party. In yet another oddity, the party has chosen not to return Emperor Ferdinand or his eldest son to power, and has instead pushed for Otto von Habsburg to take the throne. This has brought scorn from the remaining Habsburgs in the French and Mexican monarchies, as Otto has openly stated his support for the Fatherland Front. Once sheltered in France, the new Emperor of Imperial Austria is due to return and reclaim his throne."
austria.3.a:0 "All hail our new Emperor!"
austria.4.t:0 "The Traditionalists maintain power"
austria.4.d:0 "Surprising no one, the main Traditionalist block of the Fatherland Front has maintained power. Chancellor Dollfuss, addressing the Conference, stated that “only through the might of austrofascism may we bring down the damnable bolsheviks and those that sought to divide us!” While the Restorationists and the Strasserists have retreated to lick their wounds and wait for the next conference, the main party block prepares to tackle the dilemmas that continue to threaten the nation."
austria.4.a:0 "For the Fatherland!"
austria.5.t:0 "The Strasserist Block acquires control"
austria.5.d:0 "In one of the strangest transitions of power ever seen, the Strasserist block has successfully gathered support and become the dominant block within the Front. Gregor Strasser, speaking to the gathered party members, announced his resolve to strike back against those who would divide Austria. The change in leadership will leave many uneasy, as traditional ultranationalist nations attempt to distance themselves from the distinctly leftist Strasserists."
austria.5.a:0 "Forwards, to Revolution!"
austria.7.t:0 "Disbanding the Vienna Conference"
austria.7.d:0 "The Vienna Conference has long been a staple of the old Dolfuss regime. An oligarchic, pseudo-democratic process for meaningless party politics. This kind of program is the reason why the old empire collapsed. The new Emperor should be the only true authority to the regime, not some council that can fall to gridlock. The Vienna Council and their associated yearly conferences are to be disbanded immediately. This might bring ire from the Traditionalists of the Dolfuss era, but they can surely be handled."
austria.7.a:0 "Out with the Old, in with the New."
austria.8.t:0 "Electing a new Chancellor"
austria.8.d:0 "In light of the surprising internal politics of the Vienna Conference, some believe that a new chancellor should be elected to better represent the new, more united party. Incumbent Chancellor Dolfuss seems as the most obvious pick, having guided the party from its humble beginnings. Two other candidates have been proposed, Kurt Schuschnigg and Adolf Hitler. Schuschnigg, though accused of being a closet monarchist, has repeatedly proven his value to the party. His administrative talents would do well for us. Hitler, on the other hand, is an upstart [leader], fresh off fame from his writings in Prussia. New blood would certainly do the party well, but others believe we should maintain status quo."
austria.8.a:0 "Dolfuss shall remain chancellor"
austria.8.b:0 "Schuschnigg shall become chancellor"
austria.8.c:0 "Hitler shall become chancellor"
austria.10.t:0 "Traditionalist Dissent"
austria.10.d:0 "In light of the disbandment of the Vienna Council, a cadre of former Dolfuss regime leaders have made their distaste for the move known. Some have gone so far as to claim that the Emperor has tyrannically taken whatever semblance of democracy Austria had left. Even the marginalized Strasserist block has come out of the woodwork to criticize the new regime. If we don’t handle this kind of rabble carefully, we might have a serious problem on our hands."
austria.10.a:0 "The Imperial dissent spreads like a disease."
austria.11.t:0 "The Traditionalists demand a return to power!"
austria.11.d:0 "The Traditionalist dissent has grown to a fever pitch, and has now spilled out to threaten the new order. A group of traitorous military officers have collaborated with the Traditionalists to demand concessions from the Imperial regime. The primary demand has been to allow Traditionalists back into former positions of government prominence, as well as the reinstatement of the annual Vienna conferences. This would, in effect, reduce the Emperor to a mere figurehead."
austria.11.a:0 "Agree to their Demands"
austria.11.b:0 "Refuse their demands"
austria.12.t:0 "Anti-Habsburg Block forms"
austria.12.d:0 "In response to our refusal of their demands, the dissenting Traditionalists have turned to the Strasserist Block to form a coalition against our government. Already, several of our major military supporters have fled to the opposition, whether it be for ideological or more cynical, political reasons. Our regime is being seriously threatened, as each day the Opposition block continues to grow. If we don’t play our cards right, we could be looking at a full scale military coup."
austria.12.a:0 "We need to do something, fast."
austria.13.t:0 "Anti-Habsburg Coup"
austria.13.d:0 "Our worst fears have come to pass. The Opposition has launched a full scale military coup against the new Imperial government! The Austrian army has been mobilized throughout the capital and has already begun arresting key Imperial loyalists. They have submitted their demands to our regime, stating that the Emperor must either accept status as a figurehead, or risk being ousted entirely. As minor fighting breaks out throughout the nation between the loyalists and the opposition, we face dire consequences for refusal."
austria.13.a:0 "Accept the Coup"
austria.13.b:0 "This isn't over yet!"
austria.14.t:0 "Romania declares independence!"
austria.14.d:0 "The colonial government of Romania, part of the Reich’s long-term “germanization” plan, has declareded independence! Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, formerly the Austrian puppet leader of the regime, announced in Bucharest today that the Iron Guard had seized full control of the country. Reports have already come in that Pro-Romanian Iron Guard units have expelled or executed Austrian officials. With our own government in chaos, we may not be able to properly fight a revolution in Romania. How should we proceed?"
austria.14.a:0 "Let them go."
austria.14.a.tt:0 "§RThis may have dire consequences for the regime§!\n"
austria.14.b:0 "Crush them."
austria.15.t:0 "The Czechs have seized Slovakia!"
austria.16.t:0 "Revolution in Budapest!"
austria.16.d:0 "In the midst of the political chaos in Vienna, underground Hungarian resistance fighters have risen up in the streets of Budapest. Small raids against garrisoned divisions turned into full scale urban combat as the fighters took control of government buildings. Gera Lakatos, from the Budapest parliament building, announced to a gathered crowd the “new Hungarian Republic.” The military is still in shambles since the attempted coup, and has thus already been expelled from the region in and around Budapest."
austria.16.a:0 "Oh, dear."
austria.16.b:0 "Join the Rebellion (PLAY AS HUNGARY)"
austria.16.b.tt:0 "§RYou will switch from the Austrian Reich to the Hungarian Rebellion§!\n"
austria.17.t:0 "The Budapest Rebellion"
austria.17.d:0 "The provisional Hungarian government, lead by Géza Lakatos and his military junta, has submitted to us a full declaration of independence. Claiming that the Vienna government has been oppressing the Hungarians and their fellow Balkan nations for too long, they seek total independence. Our military advisors indicate that they have fortified their positions along the seized territory and are ready for a fight. Trying to take them down might be more trouble than it’s worth, but if we concede their demands, we will have forfeited our national honor."
austria.17.a:0 "We can deal with them later."
austria.17.b:0 "Crush this insolence at once!"
austria.18.t:0 "Sardinia refuses our demands"
austria.18.d:0 "Our demands for a Habsburg throne in Sardinia have been rejected. Not only that, but the Sardinian ultranationalists have turned their own public opinion against us. The ball is now in our proverbial court, and we must decide how to proceed. Standing down could make us look weak, but launching an invasion against a nation so close to the French could be a problem. How shall we proceed?"
austria.18.a:0 "Strike them down!"
austria.18.b:0 "Stand down, for now."
austria.19.t:0 "Sardinia accepts our demands"
austria.19.d:0 "Rather surprisingly, the Sardinian government has conceded our demands and allowed us to assume direct control of the Sardinian state. Rather than full annexation, a puppet government will be established under a new Habsburg monarch and administrated by the Austrian military. While this may draw some distaste from our neighbors and Europe on the whole, this has been a great victory for the Reich."
austria.19.a:0 "Onwards!"
austria.20.t:0 "Schuschnigg Addresses Vienna"
austria.20.d:0 "The new Chancellor of the Austrian Reich, Kurt Schuschnigg, addressed the Vienna Council today with a rousing speech. He declared that Austria shall once more be returned to her national greatness, and that it will seek vengeance upon those that had undone the former empire. Some in the former Entente fear that this may lead to another era of Austrian expansionism or worse, yet another Great War on the European continent. The future remains to be seen."
austria.20.a:0 "For the Fatherland!"
austria.21.t:0 "Hitler addresses Vienna"
austria.21.d:0 "“More than fourteen years have passed since the unhappy day when the Germanic peoples, blinded by promises at home and abroad, lost touch with honor and freedom, thereby losing all.” The new chancellor of the Austrian Reich, Adolf Hitler, addressed the Vienna Council today with a fiery speech. He called for a return to the height of “Germanic civilization”, and to strike back against the “traitors of the first Great War.” Hitler’s ideological radicalism has brought new life to the Austrian party and, as many former Entente observers fear, a renewed militarism and want for expansion. The future remains to be seen."
austria.21.a:0 "The future belongs to Austria!"
austria.22.t:0 "Royalists stage a Coup!"
austria.22.d:0 "The Austrian Reich is flagging. The regime has begun to collapse from sheer lack of political support. Chancellor Schuschnigg, cooperating with an underground network of moderate royalists, have staged a military coup of the government. Those still loyal to the regime have retreated to holdouts throughout the country, unwilling to recognize the writing on the wall. How the new regime will proceed remains to be seen, but it is clear that the Reich has come to a close."
austria.22.a:0 "And so the nightmare ends."
austria.23.t:0 "Royalists stage a Coup!"
austria.23.d:0 "The Austrian Reich is flagging. The regime has begun to collapse as enemy armies close in. Chancellor Schuschnigg, cooperating with an underground network of moderate royalists, have staged a military coup of the government. Those still loyal to the regime have retreated to holdouts throughout the country, unwilling to recognize the writing on the wall. How the new regime will proceed remains to be seen, but it is clear that the Reich has come to a close."
austria.23.a:0 "And so the nightmare ends."
austria.24.t:0 "The Direction of the Country"
austria.24.d:0 "The new regime is currently a transitional one, and cannot remain such forever. We need to choose how to proceed. The moderate monarchists believe that we should place the eldest son of the late Emperor Ferdinand, Maximilian, to the throne, thereby establishing Austria as a constitutional monarchy Another camp, those who were previously oppressed by the Fatherland Front, want to see the proclamation of a new Austrian Republic. With the country falling apart beyond Vienna, without the rule of law, we need to make a decision, and fast."
austria.24.a:0 "An Austrian Monarchy"
austria.24.b:0 "An Austrian Republic"
austria.25.t:0 "Peace with Britain?"
austria.25.d:0 "The war with Britain, though it helped facilitate overthrowing the Fatherland Front, is still raging. Elements of the new regime have openly advocated that we should sue for peace with the British and see if we can achieve a favorable deal. Those of a more war hawkish persuasion believe that we should prosecute the war to the bitter end, but the odds don’t look good. How should we proceed?"
austria.25.a:0 "Sue for Peace"
austria.25.b:0 "Fight to the bitter end."
austria.26.t:0 "The British Offer"
austria.26.d:0 "Rather surprisingly, the government in London has offered us a status quo white peace, returning the wartime borders to those before the conflict. This would, at least, allow us to maintain control of our existing territory until such time as we can negotiate with our neighbors. It would be foolish not to accept such a deal."
austria.26.a:0 "Accept the Deal"
austria.26.b:0 "Absolutely not!"
austria.27.t:0 "The British Offer"
austria.27.d:0 "The demands of London have come in, and they are less than exciting. The British have demanded full demilitarization of the Austrian army until such time as they allow it to operate again. Not just that, but they demand that we curtail our military programs to such a degree that the military would barely have any production capacity whatsoever. It’s a tough deal, but is peace worth the price of humiliation?"
austria.27.a:0 "I suppose it is."
austria.27.b:0 "No, it isn't."
austria.28.t:0 "The British Offer"
austria.28.d:0 "The response from London was swift, and their demands are extreme. Full occupation by the British army as, essentially, a puppet state until such time as London decides Austria is ready for independence. Not only that, but our army is to be forcibly demilitarized and our industry curtailed to prevent Austria from ever perpetrating a conflict again. It’s an incredibly one-sided deal, but are we really in a position to reject it?"
austria.28.a:0 "No, we aren't."
austria.28.b:0 "Yes, we are!"
austria.29.t:0 "The Strasser Purges"
austria.29.d:0 "Securing the country is no small feat. Chancellor Strasser believes that the Traditionalist block of the government may be conspiring against the government alongside the militias. It has been proposed that we strategically arrest potential dissidents to try and defuse any plot that might be underway. It will garner some public distaste, but we must do what is necessary to secure the new Strasserist state!"
austria.29.a:0 "Approve the Purges"
austria.29.b:0 "This is a bit much..."
austria.30.t:0 "Public Outcry against Purges"
austria.30.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, there has been public and governmental outcry against the ongoing purges. More particularly, the former Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and the traditional ultranationalists have condemned the purges and even gone so far as to accuse the new government of betraying the values of the Fatherland Front! Though the idea has been entertained that we should deal with Dollfuss himself, there are concerns that eliminating the former leader of the country could spark an outright conflict with the traditional fascists."
austria.30.a:0 "This can't go on."
austria.31.t:0 "Anti Strasserist Protests in Vienna"
austria.31.d:0 "In defiance of the government, protestors have assembled in Vienna to voice their distaste for the purges. Among those protesting are some notables of the former regime. Our advisors have suggested that we deploy the army to try and tackle the situation. We should handle the situation carefully, but choosing not to act could have dire consequences."
austria.31.a:0 "Let them shout."
austria.31.b:0 "Deploy the army and deal with them."
austria.32.t:0 "Open Dissent against the Regime!"
austria.32.d:0 "Our inaction against the protests has created even more problems. Many seditious figures in the public are now under the impression the regime has gone soft, and have begun to act more openly against us. Anti-government newspapers have been found in circulation, and the once pacified Hungarians have been discussing outright rebellion against the regime. Just the same, the Iron Guard in Romania is showing signs of similar sedition. If we don’t act quickly, we could be facing serious problems."
austria.32.a:0 "Everything is fine!"
austria.32.b:0 "Order further purges!"
austria.33.t:0 "Tradtionalist Plot?"
austria.33.d:0 "Though we have backed down on the proposed purges, it is feared that the traditional ultranationalists may be plotting against us. Dollfuss and his cronies are already believed to be conspiring against the new government. It may be necessary to mobilize our officers to apprehend Dollfuss and those allied with them, so that they may be disposed off properly. Executing the former of the Front could be a disaster for our regime, however. We should proceed carefully."
austria.33.a:0 "Execute Dollfuss and his allies!"
austria.33.b:0 "You can't be serious."
austria.34.t:0 "Dollfuss stages a Coup!"
austria.34.d:0 "This evening, during an unremarkable meeting in the Vienna Capital Building, former Chancellor Dollfuss and a cadre of loyalist officers stormed the building to demand a return to power. To demonstrate their seriousness, they have executed several of our cabinet! The authorities and the military have responded quickly, surrounding the capital building. If the coup succeeds, it could seriously damage the credibility of the regime!"
austria.34.a:0 "Dollfuss and the officers succeed."
austria.34.b:0 "The Coup Plotters are arrested."
austria.35.t:0 "The Execution of Engelbert Dollfuss"
austria.35.d:0 "With his last ditch attempt at retaining power having failed, former Chancellor Dollfuss has been arrested. A quick show trial was conducted, and Dollfuss is to be executed by firing squad. The remainder of the attempted coup plotters were similarly charged and executed without incident. While Dollfuss may be remembered as the man that brought the Reich to where it is today, his final act nearly brought it’s downfall. Let us hope history shall be kind."
austria.35.a:0 "Unfortunate, but necessary."
austria.36.t:0 "Seizure of Hungarian Business Assets"
austria.36.d:0 "A significant part of the economic recovery plan proposed at the emergency conference is the mass seizure of Hungarian business assets. This Hungarians still allowed to operate their businesses have a significant amount of potential capital. The VF militias have been ordered to arrest noted Hungarian investors and business owners, while the federal government freezes and liquidates their assets for use by the state. The move has seen some criticism, particularly from those moderates that have not been purged, but has otherwise been met with apathy and in some cases, approval. Hatred for Hungarians is still fresh in the mind of many, even years after the Betrayal of 1919."
austria.36.a:0 "Acceptable Losses"
austria.37.t:0 "Nationwide Socialist Crackdown"
austria.37.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, elements of the secret state police stormed the homes of socialists, both underground and public, dragging them into the night for summary execution. Already, dozens have been killed as part of the operation, sanctioned by the Viennese government. Communist and socialist sympathizers have fled into the countryside and the surrounding neutral nations. For all intents and purposes, today marked the effective end of socialist thought in Austria."
austria.37.a:0 "Good riddance."
austria.38.t:0 "The Polish Question"
austria.38.d:0 "The Polish Republic to our North is a product of the Treaty of Versailles, the humiliating treaty signed by the Central Powers that ended the First Great War. Since time immemorial, Poland has been subject to partitions, revolutions and annexations. To their West is the Prussian successor state, claiming rule over the ashes that were once the galant German Empire. The Poles are no friends to the Austrians, having been partitioned by the Austrian Empire in the 1700s. The military leaders and hardline fascists in the Reich believe we should pursue an expansionistic policy towards the Republic, and should use our position of strength to launch an invasion. Several diplomats have come forward, however, to suggest we take a more pragmatic approach to the Polish, even if it means we may upset our former German comrades."
austria.38.a:0 "Take a Diplomatic Approach"

austria.39.t:0 "Generalplan Ost"
austria.39.d:0 "Russia has been a failed state for some time since their pyrrhic victory against the Bolsheviks. Their land in the West is host to a large amount of resources that could be useful for the Empire. Expansion into the Russian West towards Moscow will be difficult, and thus our advisors have prepared a long term plan to acclimating our personnel for an assault into the region. With the Ukraine under our control, asserting dominance over our former enemies will fully establish the nation as a true superpower."
austria.39.a:0 "An excellent proposal"
austria.101.t:0 "Denmark Offers Nonaggression Pact"
austria.101.d:0 "Denmark, having given attention to the German situation, has extended Austria an olive branch. They propose a nonaggression pact, perhaps as a beginning to more substantial diplomatic guarantees to come."
austria.101.a:0 "We have nothing to gain from war with Denmark."
austria.101.b:0 "We have no need for such an agreement."
austria.102.t:0 "Denmark Proposes War with Westphalia"
austria.102.d:0 "Through clandestine channels, the Danish government has expressed interest in a war against Westphalia. While they insist they can take on the German pretender state on their own, they invite us to join in the fight, and to cement our good relations on the battlefield."
austria.102.a:0 "Rally the troops, we go to war!"
austria.102.b:0 "This is not the best time..."
austria.103.t:0 "Danish Officials Meet in Vienna"
austria.103.d:0 "After the fall of Westphalia, Danish officials met with members of the Austrian government in the capital city of Vienna. They offered terms for a defensive pact to protect both nations against their enemies."
austria.103.a:0 "Our interests are one and the same."
austria.103.b:0 "We like our relations as they are."
austria.104.t:0 "Denmark Asks to Join the Tripartite"
austria.104.d:0 "As the stability of Europe falls into question, Denmark asks us to strengthen our pact once more. The Danes ask to join the Tripartite Pact to protect our interests in the Baltic and Central Europe."
austria.104.a:0 "Denmark shall be a part of the German rebirth."

austria.105.t:0 "Status of the Militias"
austria.105.d:0 "The Fatherland Militias have, for some time, been the backbone of party authority. In the years since they facilitated Dolfuss’ rise to power, they have become disloyal and difficult to manage, making demands of the regime for more elite privileges. This kind of behavior will not be tolerated in the new regime. Our officers have come forwards with “Emergency Plan Blue”, a hypothetical plan drafted years ago for dealing with rebellious militia officers. Under Plan Blue, military forces would be deployed to the cities to arrest and execute militia officials.\n Alternatively, some have suggested that we bring the militia leaders to the table to negotiate a new plan for the future. While this might not totally solve the issue, it would certainly go a long way towards negating some of the less helpful aspects of relying on the militias."
austria.105.a:0 "Go forward with Plan Blue"

# AUSTRIAN EXTERNAL EVENTS

austriaexternal.1.t:0 "Pressure from Austria"
austriaexternal.1.d:0 "Our border with the Austrians has frequently been a point of contention, but it seems things have come to a head. Austrian diplomats have begun pressuring our government to accept the rule of an Austrian Habsburg. It seems that the newly crowned Emperor Otto is looking to expand his new empire beyond just the Balkans. Most of the ruling party has already dismissed the Austrian demands as absurd, but there is the concern that refusal could lead to an Austrian military intervention. "
austriaexternal.1.a:0 "Absolutely not."
austriaexternal.1.b:0 "We can't risk a fight right now."
austriaexternal.4.a.tt:0 "§RYou will become a puppet of the Austrian Reich§!\n""
austriaexternal.2.t:0 "Vienna in Chaos"
austriaexternal.2.d:0 "Vienna is in chaos. This may be our chance to seize our independence from the Reich and reclaim Romanian national honor. Elements of the Iron Guard are already poised and ready to strike at key Pro-Austrian authorities. All they need now is the order from the leadership."
austriaexternal.2.a:0 "Now is our time!"
austriaexternal.2.b:0 "No, reign the men back."
austriaexternal.3.t:0 "Seizing back Slovakia?"
austriaexternal.3.d:0 "Reports from our agents in the Austrian Reich indicate that the government is in total chaos. With the current regime unwilling to relinquish power, many of the opposing fascist groups have begun organizing and attempting a coup. Their is government completely out of control and this might be the perfect time to seize back control of our former territory in Slovakia. How shall we proceed?"
austriaexternal.3.a:0 "Take it back."
austriaexternal.3.b:0 "No, it's too dangerous."
austriaexternal.4.t:0 "The Revolution in Budapest"
austriaexternal.4.d:0 "Today shall be remembered as the day that Hungary was no longer shackled by the despotism of Austria. Under the provisional military government, Hungary shall soon be even greater than their Germanic overlords. Our forces have already seized control of Budapest and the surrounding area, and have quickly moved to fortify the unofficial borders. All that is left is to see what the response from Vienna is."
austriaexternal.4.a:0 "For the revolution!"
austriaexternal.4.a.tt:0 "§RNew divisions will be spawned.§!\n"
austriaexternal.5.t:0 "Austria sues for peace?"
austriaexternal.5.d:0 "In light of the political upset in Austria, we’ve been getting reports of defections from the Reich. These reports were unconfirmed until this morning, when a diplomatic cable was received from the former Reich seeking peace. Intelligence has confirmed that the former Fatherland Front regime has been overthrown and replaced by new management. This may be an opportune time to deal with the Austrian threat, once and for all."
austriaexternal.5.a:0 "Offer a status quo white peace."
austriaexternal.5.b:0 "Demand full demilitarization"
austriaexternal.5.c:0 "Demand full occupation!"
austriaexternal.6.t:0 "Austria refuses our offer!"
austriaexternal.6.d:0 "The new Austrian government has refused our offer for peace! The scoundrels would rather take as many down with them as they can, it seems. As our forces march for Vienna, it appears that the Second Great War shall only end with blood and fire."
austriaexternal.6.a:0 "So be it."
austriaexternal.7.t:0 "Austria accepts our offer!"
austriaexternal.7.d:0 "The new Austrian regime has accepted our offer of peace! Diplomats from Vienna and across the Commonwealth are arriving in London to hash out the details of the arrangement. Unlike the First Great War, it seems, this one was able to end with some modicum of peace. Now comes the time to rebuild, bury the fallen, and start working towards a brighter tomorrow."

austriaexternal.9.d:0 "The Reich has long been a threat to peace in the Balkans, but today word arrived from Vienna that the regime has formally announced their ambitions for the region. The Austrians claim the Balkans as their “sphere of influence”, and claim that they intend to enforce their dominance in the region. This has garnered distaste internationally, and many other Balkan nations have already stated their intent to resist Austrian hegemony. Our days as an independent state may be numbered…"
austriaexternal.9.a:0 "We must resist!"
austriaexternal.10.t:0 "Austria announces Balkan Policy"
austriaexternal.10.d:0 "The Reich has long been a threat to peace in the Balkans, but today word arrived from Vienna that the regime has formally announced their ambitions for the region. The Austrians claim the Balkans as their “sphere of influence”, and claim that they intend to enforce their dominance in the region. This has garnered distaste internationally, and many other Balkan nations have already stated their intent to resist Austrian hegemony. This has once more brought forward the concept of the Balkan League. Previously formed to resist Turkish expansion, it may be necessary to seek a general Balkan alliance once more to fight this ancient enemy."
austriaexternal.10.a:0 "We can handle the Austrians on our own."
austriaexternal.10.b:0 "We must resist. Together!"
austriaexternal.13.t:0 "Greece rejects the Deal"
austriaexternal.13.d:0 "Greece has rejected our arrangement. Whatever chance we had of inducting them into the Tripartite Pact has failed. They will stand alone when their time comes."
austriaexternal.13.a:0 "So be it."
austriaexternal.14.t:0 "The Macedonian Exchange"
austriaexternal.14.d:0 "With Macedonia now under our control, our deal with the Greeks is complete. All that is left to do is allow their troops and personnel to move into the province. Returning Macedonia to them will certainly secure Greek loyalty for quite some time. We could, of course, go back on our word. Though the consequences for such an action could be outright conflict with the Greeks."
austriaexternal.14.a:0 "Honor the Deal"
austriaexternal.14.b:0 "Backstab the Greeks"
austriaexternal.15.t:0 "Austria goes back on the deal!"
austriaexternal.15.d:0 "The dastardly Austrians have betrayed us! They have refused to return our rightful state to us, and have instead chosen to retain Macedonia for their own nefarious uses. This kind of action cannot stand!"
austriaexternal.15.a:0 "To War!"
austriaexternal.15.b:0 "Stand down. There's nothing we can do."
austriaexternal.16.t:0 "Austria honors the Deal"
austriaexternal.16.d:0 "The Austrians have honored the deal, and have returned Macedonia to us. Greeks everywhere rejoice as their brothers and sisters are freed from devilish Albanian rule. This will certainly win favor with our administration, though it will also further embolden the ultranationalist groups, who may feel vindicated in their beliefs. Despite the jubilation, we must tread carefully."
austriaexternal.16.a:0 "For Greece!"
austriaexternal.17.t:0 "Renew the Old Austrian Alliance?"
austriaexternal.17.d:0 "The days of the Central powers are long gone, and yet, we have received word from Austria that they wish to renew our former alliance. It has been some time, and the political landscape has changed quite a bit. Can we really say if the Austrians still share our beliefs? If nothing else, an alliance of convenience would give us a better chance of expanding and reclaiming our former Balkan territories. The Austrians have just as much hatred for the British and French as we do, and could be a valuable ally in the coming conflicts."
austriaexternal.17.a:0 "A Wonderful idea"
austriaexternal.17.b:0 "We'll stand alone, thanks."
austriaexternal.18.t:0 "Turkey accepts!"
austriaexternal.18.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our alliance. Diplomats have already begun drafting the details of Turkey’s induction into the Tripartite Pact. With at least  one former ally by our side, we can turn our attentions on dealing with further expansion into the Balkans and beyond."
austriaexternal.18.a:0 "For Faith and Fatherland!"
austriaexternal.19.t:0 "Turkey refuses!"
austriaexternal.19.d:0 "Turkey has refused our alliance. The Turks will stand alone in further conflicts."
austriaexternal.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
austriaexternal.20.t:0 "An Alliance with Vienna?"
austriaexternal.20.d:0 "Our ties with the Austrians have only gone so far as the First Great War and the Central Powers, and yet the Reich has delivered an invitation to join their alliance. The Tripartite Pact could be quite inviting, and could even provide a path for us to expand into Greece and beyond. The benefits are many, but there are just as many dangers. How should we proceed?"
austriaexternal.20.a:0 "Accept the Offer"
austriaexternal.20.b:0 "Reject the Offer"
austriaexternal.21.t:0 "Bulgaria accepts!"
austriaexternal.21.d:0 "Bulgaria has accepted our alliance. Diplomats have already begun drafting the details of Bulgaria's induction into the Tripartite Pact. With at least  one former ally by our side, we can turn our attentions on dealing with further expansion into the Balkans and beyond."

austriaexternal.22.t:0 "Bulgaria refuses!"
austriaexternal.22.d:0 "Bulgaria has refused our alliance. The Bulgars will stand alone in further conflicts."
austriaexternal.22.a:0 "Unfortunate."
austriaexternal.23.t:0 "The Partitioning of Bulgaria"
austriaexternal.23.d:0 "Our allies in Vienna have come to us with a proposal for the Partitioning of Bulgaria. The Ottoman Empire once held many lands in the Balkans, and reclaiming them was a major goal of our administration. This compromise might be an excellent way to accomplish that, in a way, while maintaining good relations with the Austrian Reich. Of course, hardliners in the government think we should reject the deal and annex Bulgaria in full. "
austriaexternal.23.a:0 "A Wonderful idea."
austriaexternal.23.b:0 "We're quite alright, thank you."
austriaexternal.24.t:0 "Turkey Accepts the Arrangement"
austriaexternal.24.d:0 "Ankara has accepted our arrangement. We are now free to move forward on our ambitions against the Bulgars. This will give us sufficient political capital to launch a full-scale invasion of Bulgaria."
austriaexternal.24.a:0 "Excellent."
austriaexternal.25.t:0 "Turkey Rejects the Arrangement"
austriaexternal.25.d:0 "Ankara has rejected the proposed arrangement. Without the proper military backing from Turkey, it would be wise to back down from our ambitions on Bulgaria. We can push forwards regardless, but it could prove to be a problem for our ambitions on the Balkans."
austriaexternal.25.a:0 "So be it, then."
austriaexternal.25.b:0 "Go forward with the invasion regardless!"
austriaexternal.26.t:0 "The Partitioning of Bulgaria"
austriaexternal.26.d:0 "Bulgaria is no more. As our troops begin to pacify the local population for the eventual Germanization programmes, our obligations to the Turks must be fulfilled. We must turn over the Easternmost provinces of Bulgaria to the Turkish forces to secure our alliance."
austriaexternal.26.a:0 "Honor the Deal"
austriaexternal.26.b:0 "Deal? What Deal?"
austriaexternal.27.t:0 "Austria honors the Partition"
austriaexternal.27.d:0 "With Bulgaria defeated, the Austrians have honored the arrangement to partition Bulgaria. The easternmost provinces of the nation will be turned over to us. Victorious troops rejoice as they march into the towns and villages of our former imperial provinces."
austriaexternal.27.a:0 "Turkey will reclaim her honor!"
austriaexternal.28.t:0 "Austria breaks the deal!"
austriaexternal.28.d:0 "The dastardly Austrians have broken the deal! They have retained control of the easternmost Bulgarian provinces, and have refused to acknowledge that there was a deal in the first place! "
austriaexternal.28.a:0 "To War!"
austriaexternal.28.b:0 "Stand down. We'll deal with them in time."
austriaexternal.29.t:0 "Ultimatum from Austria"
austriaexternal.29.d:0 "The final ultimatum from Austria has come. Their demands are simple. Total subjugation and annexation into the Reich. Refusal would mean war, of course. Naturally, it would be political suicide to agree to such demands. Even still, this country wasn’t built without a bit of nerve, and we didn’t go through the tumultuous years of the Balkan Wars just to spend our days shining Austrian boots. How shall we proceed?"
austriaexternal.29.a:0 "Refuse"
austriaexternal.29.b:0 "Accept their demands."
austriaexternal.30.t:0 "Serbia rejects our Demands!"
austriaexternal.30.d:0 "Serbia has rejected our demands for annexation. All other attempts at diplomacy have failed. The army is mobilized and ready for a fight. We will bring the Serbians to bear, and they will deeply regret this decision."
austriaexternal.30.a:0 "They know the price of insolence."
austriaexternal.31.t:0 "Serbia accepts our Demands!"
austriaexternal.31.d:0 "Serbia has accepted our demands, surprisingly. They have conceded to the full annexation of the country. The Serbian government will be dissolved. Several of their leaders have fled into neighboring Balkan countries, or even into the Italian states, pledging that they will continue the fight. For now, Serbia is formally a part of the Austrian Reich."
austriaexternal.31.a:0 "The Reich marches onwards!"
austriaexternal.32.t:0 "Ultimatum from Austria"
austriaexternal.32.d:0 "As the Austrians continue to expand in the Balkans, they have turned their attentions on us. An ultimatum from Vienna has already be received, demanding full annexation under threat of war. Naturally, it would be political suicide to accept such and agreement. Even then, it would be suicide to reject it. If we refuse the Austrian demands, we must prepare ourselves for war."
austriaexternal.32.a:0 "Refuse their Demands"
austriaexternal.32.b:0 "Accept their demands"
austriaexternal.33.t:0 "Bosnia rejects our Demands!"
austriaexternal.33.d:0 "Bosnia has rejected our demands for annexation. All other attempts at diplomacy have failed. The army is mobilized and ready for a fight. We will bring the Bosniaks to bear, and they will deeply regret this decision."
austriaexternal.33.a:0 "They know the price of insolence."
austriaexternal.34.t:0 "Bosnia accepts our Demands!"
austriaexternal.34.d:0 "Bosnia has accepted our demands, surprisingly. They have conceded to the full annexation of the country. The Bosnian government will be dissolved. Several of their leaders have fled into neighboring Balkan countries, or even into the Italian states, pledging that they will continue the fight. For now, Bosnia is formally a part of the Austrian Reich."
austriaexternal.34.a:0 "The Reich marches onwards!"
austriaexternal.35.t:0 "Austria demands annexation"
austriaexternal.35.d:0 "It seems that not even Albania is safe from the Austrian threat. Demands have been received from the Austrian government for complete annexation under pain of war. We can’t concede to such a demand of course. It seems as though it were intentionally written to spark us to conflict. Refusing such a demand will, of course, mean conflict with Vienna. How shall we proceed?"
austriaexternal.35.a:0 "Refuse their demands"
austriaexternal.35.b:0 "Accept the Demands"
austriaexternal.36.t:0 "Albania rejects our Demands!"
austriaexternal.36.d:0 "Albania has rejected our demands for annexation. All other attempts at diplomacy have failed. The army is mobilized and ready for a fight. We will bring the Albanians to bear, and they will deeply regret this decision."
austriaexternal.36.a:0 "They know the price of insolence."
austriaexternal.37.t:0 "Albania accepts our Demands!"
austriaexternal.37.d:0 "Albania has accepted our demands, surprisingly. They have conceded to the full annexation of the country. The Albanian government will be dissolved. Several of their leaders have fled into neighboring Balkan countries, or even into the Italian states, pledging that they will continue the fight. For now, Albania is formally a part of the Austrian Reich."
austriaexternal.37.a:0 "The Reich marches onwards!"
austriaexternal.38.t:0 "Ultimatum from Austria"
austriaexternal.38.d:0 "It seems that not even Croatia is safe from the Austrian threat. Demands have been received from the Austrian government for complete annexation under pain of war. We can’t concede to such a demand of course. It seems as though it were intentionally written to spark us to conflict. Refusing such a demand will, of course, mean conflict with Vienna. How shall we proceed?"
austriaexternal.38.a:0 "Reject the demands"
austriaexternal.38.b:0 "Concede to their demands"
austriaexternal.39.t:0 "Croatia rejects our Demands!"
austriaexternal.39.d:0 "Croatia has rejected our demands for annexation. All other attempts at diplomacy have failed. The army is mobilized and ready for a fight. We will bring the Croatians to bear, and they will deeply regret this decision."
austriaexternal.39.a:0 "They know the price of insolence."
austriaexternal.40.t:0 "Croatia accepts our Demands!"
austriaexternal.40.d:0 "Croatia has accepted our demands, surprisingly. They have conceded to the full annexation of the country. The Croatian government will be dissolved. Several of their leaders have fled into neighboring Balkan countries, or even into the Italian states, pledging that they will continue the fight. For now, Croatia is formally a part of the Austrian Reich."
austriaexternal.40.a:0 "The Reich marches onwards!"
austriaexternal.41.t:0 "Orders from Vienna"
austriaexternal.41.d:0 "Orders have arrived from Vienna. The long planned Romanian Integration Programme has begun. Advisors have arrived to assist our colonial administration in how to best integrate the Romanian population into the Reich. Germanization is a key point of the plan, and we have been ordered to begin crackdowns on any Romanian nationalist organizations that might push back. Most particularly, there is the issue of the Restorationists, who wish to see a return of the exiled Romanian monarchy. The first major stage of the programme is to begin actively suppressing any non-government entities, particularly news organizations that may harbor anti-Austrian or Bolshevik ideas. There will certainly be pushback, but nothing worse than what the Austrians will do if we fail to properly integrate."
austriaexternal.41.a:0 "Unfortunate, but necessary."
austriaexternal.42.t:0 "Purging of the Iron Guard"
austriaexternal.42.d:0 "Just this evening, further orders from Vienna have arrived. All acting members of the Iron Guard are to be arrested effective immediately. This comes as no surprise, as the Reichskommissariat government has tolerated their de-facto control since the monarchy was overthrown in the late 1930s. Codreanu, the head of the Reichskommissariat’s colonial police force, staged a failed last stand at their headquarters in Bucharest. He has since been arrested and executed, with the remaining members of the Iron Guard having fled into Ukraine and beyond. For now, the sole power in the Reichskommissariat lies with the Austrian loyalists, for better or for worse."
austriaexternal.42.a:0 "Better them than us."
austriaexternal.42.b:0 "The Purge Backfires. The Iron Guard Rebels!"
austriaexternal.43.t:0 "The Integration of the Iron Guard"
austriaexternal.43.d:0 "The Iron Guard has been a staple of the Reichskommissariat regime since it was first conceived. A mutual agreement was made under the Treaty of Bucharest which placed the Iron Guard in command of the Reichskommissariat’s secret state police. As part of the Romanian Integration Programme, the Vienna government has pushed for an integration of the Iron Guard and the Austrian secret police to better maintain control over the colony. The more moderate solution could improve relations as the Reichskommissariat continues to be integrated into the Greater Austrian Reich."
austriaexternal.43.a:0 "Better an open hand than a loaded gun."
austriaexternal.44.t:0 "Colonial Government Bans Orthodox Faith"
austriaexternal.44.d:0 "As part of the continuing Germanization programme, the Eastern Orthodox faith has been outlawed in the Reichskommissariat. Officers of the State Police are already working to arrest members of the clergy. Impromptu executions have already taken place for those unwilling to renounce their faith. Public outcry has been extreme, with riots underway across the nation. The armed forces can incapacitate them, as they always have. All structures and symbols of supposed “Slavic corruption” are being destroyed by our colonial masters."
austriaexternal.44.a:0 "All for the greater good. Right?"
austriaexternal.45.t:0 "Restorationist Crackdown"
austriaexternal.45.d:0 "Since the Romanian monarchy was deposed by the Austrians years ago, there has been an underground network of individuals seeking to bring them back to power. Carol II, the current claimant to the throne, resides in exile in Ukraine. State secret police under the purview of the Austrian government have begun a national crackdown against Restorationists. Several Restorationist partisan groups have been arrested and executed. This will naturally incur public outcry, but that’s nothing we can’t handle."
austriaexternal.45.a:0 "This is fine. Everything is fine."
austriaexternal.46.t:0 "The Austrian Settlement Initiative"
austriaexternal.46.d:0 "As the Integration Programme continues, the Austrian Colonial Authorities have begun pushing for settlement of the Romanian territory. The secret state police, on orders from Vienna, have begun seizing the Romanian lands for settlement. Their former inhabitants are being shifted towards “resettlement” facilities, to be moved to areas specifically designated for Romanian inhabitants. Outcry has come from Romanians within the colonial government, claiming that these facilities are thinly veiled detention centers and that the practice is unethical. Such individuals have been dealt with swiftly by the Austrians. The settlement programme brings the Reichskommissariat further towards full annexation. "
austriaexternal.46.a:0 "We'll have to make due."
austriaexternal.47.t:0 "Vienna bans the Romanian Language"
austriaexternal.47.d:0 "Yet more orders from the Austrian government. The Romanian language, used in the region for centuries, is to be effectively banned following full annexation. The announcement has been met with widespread criticism by those Romanians not displaced by the settlement programme. Riots in the resettlement facilities outside Bucharest have lead to several dead and widespread property damage. Vienna assures us that these measures will ensure absolute “germanization” over the course of the coming years."
austriaexternal.47.a:0 "Oh, no."
austriaexternal.48.t:0 "Forced Labour Directive"
austriaexternal.48.d:0 "Effective immediately, decreed by the Austrian government, the resettlement facilities are to begin instituting forced labour programmes. All individuals within the facilities are to be allocated a required amount of daily labour to “provide for the greatness of the Empire.” This has come to include activities such as harvesting crops, mining and factory work. Those critics of the regime that remain have declared the programme little more than slavery. Regardless of the ethics, the orders must be followed, lest we incur the wrath of the Reich."
austriaexternal.48.a:0 "Just following orders."
austriaexternal.49.t:0 "Final Integration"
austriaexternal.49.d:0 "With the completion of the Romanian Integration Programme, the terms of full annexation have been provided to our government. The Reichskommissariat will be formally dissolved and the region will be officially annexed into the Reich."
austriaexternal.49.a:0 "Accept the Terms"
austriaexternal.49.b:0 "Reject the Terms"
austriaexternal.50.t:0 "Austrian Economic Exploitation"
austriaexternal.50.d:0 "In response to the economic crisis, the Vienna government has demanded a change to our current economic policy. The Romanian oil fields, long a source of wealth for the nation and her master, are to come under total Austrian control. Any wealth extracted from the fields is to go directly to the Reich’s government, rather than our own. Elements of our government have issued token protests, but with the threat of detainment on the table, they’ve mostly gone silent."
austriaexternal.50.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
austriaexternal.51.t:0 "Diplomats from Vienna"
austriaexternal.51.d:0 "The Polish Republic is a new nation, only birthed within the last few decades through the Treaty of Versailles. In centuries past, we had been shunned and invaded, partitioned between vast empires. Today, one of our former enemies seems to be reaching out to us. Diplomats from the Austrian Reich, the supposed successor to the fallen Austro-Hungarian Empire, have offered an alliance to us. The Poles are no friends to the Austrians, but an alliance of convenience against outside enemies could prove valuable. Particularly with the Prussians to our west seeking to reclaim their old provinces."
austriaexternal.51.a:0 "The Enemy of our Enemy is our Friend"
austriaexternal.51.b:0 "We don't make deals with ultranationalists"
austriaexternal.52.t:0 "Poland Accepts"
austriaexternal.52.d:0 "The Polish government has accepted our proposal for an alliance. Their delegation has arrived in Vienna to discuss the terms of the alliance."
austriaexternal.52.a:0 "Excellent"
austriaexternal.53.t:0 "Poland Refuses"
austriaexternal.53.d:0 "The Polish government has refused our proposal for an alliance. Clearly they have ambitions of their own that do not line up with ours."
austriaexternal.53.a:0 "They stand alone."
austriaexternal.54.t:0 "The Danzig Exchange"
austriaexternal.54.d:0 "The small state of Danzig, though typically unimportant on a grand scale, was once part of the now dead German Empire. Reacquiring it has been a key goal of our administration since the fires of the Weimar Civil War finally died. The territory previously belonged to the Poles, who had seized it as the nation fell into anarchy. Now, Poland has fallen to the revived Austrian Empire, and they have offered control of the region to our government. The only catch is that in exchange for Danzig, we must join the Austrian “Tripartite Pact” alliance."
austriaexternal.54.a:0 "Take the deal. Danzig is properly Prussian!"
austriaexternal.54.b:0 "The Austrians can't be trusted."
austriaexternal.55.t:0 "Austria Announces support for Prussia"
austriaexternal.55.d:0 "The subject of German Reunification has been a hot button topic since the unofficial peace in late 1933. The former German Empire has been split along ideological and social lines since then, with the French and British interesting in maintaining it as such. The ramshackle alliance of ultranationalists and militaristic factions that form “Prussia” have aligned themselves with the Austrian Reich. The Reich itself has now announced to the world their support of a Prussian unified Germany, which would almost certainly be a hardcore ultranationalist Germany. "
austriaexternal.55.a:0 "How dare they!"
austriaexternal.56.t:0 "Austria demands the Sudetenland"
austriaexternal.56.d:0 "Since the end of the Great War, our nation has owned a small portion of territory formerly controlled by the German Empire. The German minority in the region has been somewhat vocal in recent years about their wishing to return to the control of the Empire. The political situation in Germany had made that quite impossible in recent years. Now, the Austrian Reich to our south claims itself a “true pan-German state”, and has submitted their demands that the Sudetenland be returned to them immediately under threat of war."
austriaexternal.56.a:0 "We have no other choice..."
austriaexternal.56.b:0 "Who do they think they are?"
austriaexternal.57.t:0 "The Czechs cede the Sudetenland"
austriaexternal.57.d:0 "The Czechs have given in to our demands. The Sudetenland has been ceded to the Austrian Reich. We can now push forward to make our claims on the other German territories currently under foreign oppression."
austriaexternal.57.a:0 "Excellent"
austriaexternal.58.t:0 "The Czechs reject our demands"
austriaexternal.58.d:0 "The Czechs have rejected our demands. The only true course we have now is a full-scale invasion to enforce our claim on the Sudetenland. This will draw ire from the international community, but it shouldn’t be anything we can’t handle."
austriaexternal.58.a:0 "They know the price of resistance."
austriaexternal.58.b:0 "Stand down. We can't risk it right now."
austriaexternal.59.t:0 "The Rhineland Demands"
austriaexternal.59.d:0 "The campaign of Austrian expansionism has all lead to this. A delegation from the Reich has submitted demands to our government that the Rhineland be turned over to be formally annexed by the Prussian state. The Rhenish Republic has been a de-facto puppet state of France since the intervention in the Weimar Civil War. The issue has firmly divided the government, with many believing that any further appeasement of Germanic expansionism might embolden them. Those pushing for peace have argued that the Rhineland was, legally speaking, German territory. With the Austrians now pushing for reunification under the Ultranationalist Prussian banner, they claim that their German allies are entitled to the land by right. The greatest concern has come from those Germans living in the Rhineland, who have voiced fears that the last vestiges of the Republic’s democracy will be stamped out by Prussian jackboots. We’re in a very poor position right now, and we need to make a decision."
austriaexternal.59.a:0 "Give them what they want."
austriaexternal.59.b:0 "Absolutely not."
austriaexternal.60.t:0 "France Agrees to our Demands"
austriaexternal.60.d:0 "The French have folded to our demands. The Rhineland shall be annexed and reincorporated into the new German Reich. The traitors that sold out their German comrades have fled into France, to be sheltered by their treacherous government. This mass exodus has drained much of the region, leaving only those in support of our government remaining. Nonetheless, it shall be properly Germanized in due time and cleansed of any remnant of the decadent, Bolshevik French menace. Our Prussian comrades have assured us that, with the reacquisition of the Rhineland, that we have won their total support."
austriaexternal.60.a:0 "Onwards, comrades!"
austriaexternal.61.t:0 "France refuses to cede the Rhineland"
austriaexternal.61.d:0 "Our demands have been rebuffed. The French have stated that they have no intention of handing over the Rhineland to us, or to our Prussian comrades. Their diplomats have even gone so far as to insult us, making the counter-demand that we “mind our own business.” The Prussians have already made their feelings on the matter known, and if we stand down, we could risk everything."
austriaexternal.61.a:0 "Bring them to their knees."
austriaexternal.61.b:0 "We can't risk it right now."
austriaexternal.62.t:0 "Austria stands down"
austriaexternal.62.d:0 "The Austrians have stood down on their push for the Rhenish annexation. Their delegation has left Paris defeated, likely to face harsh repercussions on return to Vienna. For now, it seems this test of luck has played out well for us. If nothing else, maintaining the Rhenish state will give us a foothold against Austro-Prussian attack if they choose to return. "
austriaexternal.62.a:0 "Long live the French Empire!"
austriaexternal.63.t:0 "Operation Kino"
austriaexternal.63.d:0 "Our alliance with Poland was one of convenience, and it is no longer convenient to us. Our military advisors have proposed the so-called “Operation Kino” to deal with the Polish question once and for all. The secret state police will, on our orders, move to arrest any Polish diplomats or politicians in the country. At the same time, strike forces within Poland will begin hitting key infrastructure wherever possible. If successful, the Polish government will be too crippled to prevent the subsequent invasion."
austriaexternal.63.a:0 "The Poles were dead weight anyway."
austriaexternal.64.t:0 "Betrayed!"
austriaexternal.64.d:0 "We have been betrayed! The Austrians have seized at least a dozen of our diplomats and conducted strikes within the country is a devious covert operation. It seems the Reich wants a future that does not include us, and now we must turn out guns against our ancient enemy. Poland will never give in, and will never surrender!"
austriaexternal.64.a:0 "We will never bow to the Reich!"
austriaexternal.65.t:0 "An Offer from Vienna"
austriaexternal.65.d:0 "Diplomatic envoys have arrived from Vienna today, with a proposal to expand their alliance against the former Entente to include Japan. Our empire has little love for the British, but some ministers have objected to the idea of becoming involved in European entanglements. The opposite camp has proposed that we could easily gain from the alliance, as the seizure of Indonesia and Oceania could prove a boon for the Empire. The British would likely be more concerned with maintaining their North American holdings than fighting the IJN in the Pacific."
austriaexternal.65.a:0 "Together, we are strong."
austriaexternal.65.b:0 "We have no interest in European affairs."
austriaexternal.66.t:0 "Japan joins the Tripartite Pact"
austriaexternal.66.d:0 "Word arrived from the East today. The Japanese have agreed to our alliance, and our diplomats have begun drafting the terms of the arrangement. With this, the Tripartite Pact has become a truly global alliance, and further strengthened our position against the British and French Empires. The Japanese may be in this for more pragmatic concerns in the Pacific, but the cooperation of the IJN and IJA with the Reich will be a boon for the coming war effort."
austriaexternal.66.a:0 "Fantastic"
austriaexternal.67.t:0 "Japan refuses our alliance"
austriaexternal.67.d:0 "The Japanese government has refused our alliance, stating their intention not to become involved in European conflicts. Our diplomatic delegation will return to Vienna empty handed, and the potential for opening up a Pacific front is no longer an option. We must look elsewhere."
austriaexternal.67.a:0 "Unfortunate."
austriaexternal.68.t:0 "Renew diplomatic ties with Austria?"
austriaexternal.68.d:0 "The shots fired by Mexican nationalists were the shots that would spark the Great War, and the North American front proved one of the bloodiest of the entire conflict. Our empire has suffered greatly since then, damaged by internal strife and economic collapse. Our former allies in Europe have turned their gaze back to Mexico, and seek to renew ties for a coming second war against the Entente. The aid from Austria could prove to be the stimulus that the flagging Mexican economy needs to get back on it’s feet, but such open cooperation might embolden far-right elements of our society."
austriaexternal.68.a:0 "Of course!"
austriaexternal.68.b:0 "Absolutely not."
austriaexternal.69.t:0 "Mexico joins the Tripartite Pact"
austriaexternal.69.d:0 "The Mexican government has accepted our offer of a diplomatic alliance. Delegations have arrived in Mexico City to discuss the terms of the arrangement. The Tripartite Pact has now become a true, global alliance, and we are now assured to open a second front against the British colonies when war comes to Europe again."
austriaexternal.69.a:0 "Excellent"
austriaexternal.70.t:0 "Mexico refuses our Alliance"
austriaexternal.70.d:0 "The Mexican government has rejected our offer of alliance, and seems more interested in focusing on North American affairs than renewing the great struggle against British dominance. The vestigial empire will fall alone, it seems."
austriaexternal.70.a:0 "How unfortunate."
austriaexternal.71.t:0 "An Alliance of Convenience"
austriaexternal.71.d:0 "Since our liberation from Russian hegemony during the Civil War, the rump state in Moscow has always had a keen interest in regaining their lost territories. It is because of this antagonism that the Austrian government has approached us with a proposition for an alliance against the Russians. The Reich has made their thoughts on so-called “Slavic inferiority” well known, ergo it is clear that this is little more than a temporary alliance. Collaboration might earn us mercy, but it might also earn us a knife in the back."
austriaexternal.71.a:0 "It seems that we have mutual interests."
austriaexternal.71.b:0 "We'll never cooperate with Austrian swine!"
austriaexternal.72.t:0 "Caucasia agrees to our Alliance"
austriaexternal.72.d:0 "The Caucasians have agreed to our alliance. For now, we have another ally in our coming conflict against the Russians. They may be Slavs, and they may be untrustworthy, but we can certainly deal with them once Moscow is dealt with."
austriaexternal.72.a:0 "An alliance. For now."
austriaexternal.73.t:0 "Caucasia refuses our alliance."
austriaexternal.73.d:0 "The Caucasians have refused our alliance, and seem more interested in staying out of a coming conflict with the Russians."
austriaexternal.73.a:0 "We'll deal with them later, then."
austriaexternal.74.t:0 "The Issue of Caucasia"
austriaexternal.74.d:0 "With the Russians defeated and the West in the process of Germanization, our generals have turned their attention to our allies in Caucasia. The resources of the region are potentially quite useful, particularly the untapped potential of oil in the South. However, the government of Caucasia is still closely controlled by the Jughashvili dictatorship. Eliminating him could destabilize their government enough to allow us to step in and take over with minimal bloodshed. Our generals have proposed a decisive strike on their capital to arrest Jughashvili and his cabinet while military garrisons on the border strike. If executed correctly, we could decapitate their leadership before they have time to respond."
austriaexternal.74.a:0 "Let's hope this works."
austriaexternal.75.t:0 "The Coup Attempt Succeeds!"
austriaexternal.75.d:0 "Our plans have come to fruition. Jughashvili and his cabinet have been dealt with, and most of the Caucasian garrisons have retreated. Though some token resistance remains in the South, Grand Caucasia is, for all intents and purposes, now under the command of the Austrian government. A cabal of officers have been selected to take command of the new colonial government to oversee the establishment of resettlement facilities and forced labour initiatives. "
austriaexternal.75.a:0 "The region is now ours!"
austriaexternal.76.t:0 "Austrian-backed Coup Succeeds"
austriaexternal.76.d:0 "The dastardly Austrians have staged a coup in our capital! Our grand leader, Commander Jughashvili has been arrested by elements of the Austrian army. Garrisons on the Northern border have been seized as the Austrian forces march to take control of our nation. All is lost, it seems, as we too are soon to fall to the Austrian jackboot."
austriaexternal.76.a:0 "Allow the new regime to take control."
austriaexternal.76.b:0 "This cannot happen! To War!"
austriaexternal.77.t:0 "The Coup attempt fails!"
austriaexternal.77.d:0 "Catastrophe in Grand Caucasia! Our attempted coup was sussed out and defeated by Jughashvili, and he has rallied the nation in defiance of so-called “Austrian deviance.” Our diplomats in the nation have already been rounded up and executed, and it seems that our conflicts with the peoples of Caucasia will now be settled on the battlefield."
austriaexternal.77.a:0 "Oh, no."
austriaexternal.78.t:0 "Austrian-backed Coup fails!"
austriaexternal.78.d:0 "Terrible news from the capital! The Austrians, our dastardly allies of convenience, have attempted to assassinate our dear leader Commander Jughashvili in an underhanded act of espionage! Though the coup-plotters have been dealt with, we must now turn our attentions against the growing Reich, and must now stand as a bulwark against their expansions. The question of Caucasia shall now be settled on the battlefield. To War!"
austriaexternal.78.a:0 "We knew this was coming. To War!"
austriaexternal.79.t:0 "The Ukrainain Occupation Zone"
austriaexternal.79.d:0 "With Ukraine now firmly in Austrian control, it has been proposed that we establish a puppet government in the region. Referred to as the “Ukrainian Occupation Zone”, the region would allow us to more easily administrate the large un-germanized population and prepare them for resettlement and Austrian direct control."
austriaexternal.79.a:0 "Allow the Zone to be established"
austriaexternal.79.b:0 "Continue direct military administration"
austriaexternal.80.t:0 "The French Occupation Zone"
austriaexternal.80.d:0 "With France now firmly in Austrian control, it has been proposed that we establish a puppet government in the region. Referred to as the “French Occupation Zone”, the region would allow us to more easily administrate the large un-germanized population and prepare them for resettlement and Austrian direct control."
austriaexternal.80.a:0 "Establish the Occupation Zone"
austriaexternal.80.b:0 "Continue direct military administration"
austriaexternal.81.t:0 "The English Occupation Zone"
austriaexternal.81.d:0 "With Britain now firmly in Austrian control, it has been proposed that we establish a puppet government in the region. Referred to as the “English Occupation Zone”, the region would allow us to more easily administrate the large un-germanized population and prepare them for resettlement and Austrian direct control."
austriaexternal.81.a:0 "Establish the Occupation Zone"
austriaexternal.81.b:0 "Continue direct military administration"
austriaexternal.82.t:0 "The Macedonian Exchange"
austriaexternal.82.d:0 "Macedonia is a traditionally Greek state, seized by the Albanian military during the chaos of the First Great War. Reacquiring it has been a major sticking point in subsequent elections. A diplomat from the Austrian Reich has approached with an arrangement. In exchange for assisting them militarily, they will return control of Macedonia to us once the Albanians are dealt with. Taking the deal might embolden ultranationalist elements within our own society, but rejecting it would put us in a position to be attacked by the Austrians or the increasingly aggressive Turks without support."
austriaexternal.82.a:0 "Take the Deal"
austriaexternal.82.b:0 "Reject the Deal"
austriaexternal.83.t:0 "Greece accepts the Deal"
austriaexternal.83.d:0 "Greece has accepted the arrangement, and we have sent diplomats to formalize the agreement. The Greek nation will join our ranks in the Tripartite Pact."
austriaexternal.83.a:0 "Wonderful"

austriaflavour.1.d:0 "A group of armed Hungarian partisans have bombed a major government building in our country! Several people are dead, and many more are wounded. Outrage has broken out against the ethnic Hungarian populations in many major cities and ghettoes. A spat of Anti-Hungarian violence has broken out among the population, but has since been contained by the authorities. "

austriaflavour.2.t:0 "The Black Hand"
austriaflavour.2.d:0 "Since our annexation of Serbia, attacks by small partisan groups have not been uncommon. However, elements of the state police have begun to come into contact with a group known as “The Black Hand.” Believed to consist of former elements of the Serbian intelligence service, along with trained terrorists, the Black Hand is well armed and trained, and has proved more than a match for our militias and police. If we don’t do something about this ominous organization soon, we may face serious consequences."
austriaflavour.2.a:0 "Send the State Police to hunt them down!"
austriaflavour.2.b:0 "They pose no real threat to us."
austriaflavour.3.t:0 "Black Hand Bombings"
austriaflavour.3.d:0 "Treachery in Serbia! The Black Hand terrorist group has attacked one of our administrative buildings with handmade bombs! While relatively few were injured, it has frazzled the nerves of many of our commanders in the occupation zone. They have outright demanded that we take some kind of measure to deal with the black hand threat, lest we risk open rebellion by an emboldened Serbian population."
austriaflavour.3.a:0 "Perhaps we should take this more seriously..."
austriaflavour.3.b:0 "It's just a small bombing. No real concern."
austriaflavour.4.t:0 "Skirmish with Black Hand Partisans"
austriaflavour.4.d:0 "Earlier today, one of our patrols in Serbia was able to hunt down and defeat a group of partisans working under the Black Hand. At least twenty men were captured and interrogated, with much of their equipment seized. Among those interrogated, we’ve gathered information on the possible hideout of these hooligans. Just as well, we were able to retrieve vital information on Black Hand safe houses throughout Serbia! "

 finland.1.t:0 "The Finnish Situation"
 finland.1.d:0 "Finland gained its independence during the chaos of the Great War. Russian Civil War started, Finland declared independent and quickly seized the Kola peninsula, Onega and Olonets regions with its newly formed Finnish Army. When the Russian Civil War was reaching its end, the pro-Czarist forces were winning with the help of the United Kingdom. Once the bolsheviks were crushed, Russia turned its gaze against Finland. Luckily for Finland, the British intervened and ordered Russia to step down. The British were the first country in the world to acknowledge the new Finnish nation. Quickly, following the British lead, other countries did so as well and thus the Finnish nation was born."
 finland.1.a:0 "Wait...there's more?"
 finland.111.t:0 "The Finnish Situation Continued"
 finland.111.d:0 "Rather soon after the newly gained independence, a big political debate started in Finland about the composition of the government and what kind of form. A German king was planned and proposed to lead the country, but that caused the socialists quickly rise to the barricades, culminating in a civil war between the socialist Reds and the non-socialist Whites in 1918. The Whites came out victorious from the civil war, and the capital was set in Vaasa; the capital of White Finland during the civil war. Since then, White Finland has been ruled by the militarist junta. The political climate in Finland is rather stable for now, but situation in the world may change that..."
 finland.111.a:0 "Ok. Let's do this!"
 finland.2.t:0 "London Stock Crisis"
 finland.2.d:0 "Panic in the streets of London this morning as the ongoing economic stagnation has finally reached a head. Stock prices had been soaring for years since the late 1920s, and it seemed that the prices had reached a permanent high plateau. That idea came crashing down last night following a sudden loss in market value at the stocks. The ensuing panic has already spread to investors throughout the nation. Panic sales peaked to the point that some didn’t even have buyers, breaking the record of stocks sold in one evening by an unimaginable margin. This morning, the aftermath is clear. The British economy is already in a tailspin; several major companies have already folded, leaving millions throughout the nation without work. Nicknamed “The Slump” by some in the government, this crisis has already birthed the worst economic downturn in modern British history. The British being Finland's biggest trading partner, the crisis had immediate effects on Finnish economy, nearly halting our production"
 finland.2.a:0 "Perkele!"
 finland.3.t:0 "Elections Cancelled!"
 finland.3.d:0 "The long waited first free democratic elections promised by the military junta government have been cancelled. The head of state, Vihtori Kosola, addressed the people in Vaasa. 'The future of Finland, and the world, is on its edge. Following the London Stock Crisis, the world is in turmoil. We need to be strong and unified. This is not the time for democracy!' he preached.

sweden.1.t:0 "Sweden In 1936"
sweden.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Sweden has been around since the early 12th century, it has fought many wars, victories and loses. Although peacefull in The Great War, Sweden did support both sides with resources, Sweden nearly joined in the war when a group of Swedish communists hijacked a German ship and had pretend to be members of The Swedish Navy, this lead to massive diplomatic meetings between His Majesty The King and the Kaiser of Germany. After the meetings Sweden and Germany successsully avoided war. Although Sweden was forced to disarm its border with Norway which had been heavily armed since the beginning of The Great War, relations grew greatly between Sweden and Norway due to this. After The Great War some saw The Swedish King as a coward and this forced him to liberalize his nation handing more power to the parliament and Prime Minister, in the mid 20s a far right organization called The Nordic Revival Party of Sweden was found by Birger Furugård, at first the NRP acted as a paramilitary that performed many attacks on jews, government buildings and leftist sites. Finally in 1932 the NRP and Furugård resigned as a paramiltary and became an offical party, many were purged from the party who were suspected of not being loyal to Birger Furugård. In 1935 Birger Furugård and the NRP became an offical choice on the 1936 Election ballot, and with support from many accross Sweden, their chances of winning are high, we are now here in 1936 a new year, a year that could change the fate of Sweden forever."

Many have accused Bagge of being lazy, a politician who won't pass reforms. Birger Furugård is also considered someone who may not be elected over the other two due to his anti-semitic policies, even though anti-semitism is a rising policy in Sweden. Only time will tell who can win this election, as the results begin to come in."

Aligned to the nascent monarchy, the military forces have arrested government officials in a relatively bloodless coup. With this, our government is transitioning into a monarchist government, and it remains to be seen how the status of civil liberties will be changed."
political.1.a:0 "Long live the King!"
political.2.t:0 "Failed Monarchist Coup"
political.2.d:0 "Elements of the military have made an aborted coup of the government, in an attempt to install a monarchy. The coup has failed, and the ruling government has fled into the countryside to organize a resistance. The prospect of a civil war has become terribly, terribly real."
political.2.a:0 "The ruling party will not allow this..."
political.3.t:0 "Pro-Military Coup"
political.3.d:0 "Elements of a vast, popular military clique stormed the government districts just this evening. Heavily armed, their leadership has demanded total control over the government. With much of the government arrested by the clique, there is no organized resistance to prevent the coup."
political.3.a:0 "The authoritarians shall guide us!"
political.4.t:0 "Failed Military Coup"
political.4.d:0 "A military coup has attempted to seize control of the government. The failed coup has allowed many key government officials to slip through the cracks, where they have fled into the countryside to organize a resistance. Having enlisted elements of the loyalists, the exiled government has announced their intention to fight the coup plotters. A civil war is in full swing."
political.4.a:0 "The ruling party will not allow this..."
political.5.t:0 "Ultranationalist Coup"
political.5.d:0 "Backed by the military, fascist paramilitaries have seized control of the capital and arrested government officials. Reports of violence in the streets have begun to come in as the nascent ultranationalists announced their victory. With the existing government scattered, resistance has been minimal. The coup has been relatively bloodless and, more importantly, a resounding success."
political.5.a:0 "Today, the capital. Tomorrow, the world!"
political.6.t:0 "Failed Ultranationalist Coup"
political.6.d:0 "The ruling government has fled the capital as ultranationalist militias attempt to seize control. The failed coup has sparked widespread national resistance as fighting begins throughout the nation. The threat of a potential civil war has now become a very real one."
political.6.a:0 "The ruling party will not allow this..."
political.7.t:0 "Pro-Communist Coup"
political.7.d:0 "Elements of the military have seized control of the government and forced the ruling party into exile. From the steps of the capital, elements of the nation’s communist party announced the creation of a new worker’s republic. "
political.7.a:0 "We have stood up!"
political.8.t:0 "Failed Communist Coup"
political.8.d:0 "The ruling government has fled the capital as forces of the pro-communist military attempt to seize control. Having not gained the support of the military, the ruling government has been able to organize a popular resistance against us. A civil war is now in full swing."
political.8.a:0 "The ruling party will not allow this..."
political.9.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Snap Elections"
