PB_AME_john_curtin_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 8/1/1885\n\n§YJohn Curtin§! has been involved in the American political sphere from as young as 13, joining the Boston Trade Union after leaving school and eventually finding a job in the then young All-American Socialist League. However, his time in socialist politics quickly ended seeing that many held rather pro-war views during the Great War in a bid to earn more popular support nationally and abroad. John Curtin would politically bounce around until finally finding a place in the American Liberal Party. Semi-famous for his anti-war stance during the Great War, he was one of the few outspoken critics of Operation Overlord in American politics at the time. It is likely that this anti-war stance Curtin has adopted brought him the few extra necessary votes from the remaining American veteran population that earnt him the highest seat in politics.\n\nCurrently Curtin has campaigned on three promises, one is the total overhaul of the Commonwealth war debts that have piled high since the Treaty of Tours and stands as his most popular campaign point. Second is his determination to finally resolve the Southern Issue, a contentious political dream that scared many within the Liberal party from initially putting forward John Curtin as their Prime Minister of choice. And finally, there is the question of the Native reservations that he has promised to resolve once and for all."
PB_AME_william_aberhart_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/12/1878\n\n§YWilliam Aberhart§! Previously a primary school teacher, with great love for Oliver Cromwell, he rose the ranks quickly as he became well respected by his students and colleagues, until he eventually became the school's principal. During the Great War, William developed an ever growing interest in politics, especially when seeing how the war affected the farmers of the region where he came from. Thus around 1929, William decided he would take matters into his own hands and join the political scene. Like before he quickly rose through the ranks and found himself a lovely spot at the top of the party."
PB_Charles_Hughes_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 11/4/1862\n\n§YCharles Evan Hughes§! Descending from Welsh immigrants, he had the pleasure of being able to study law at the university of Philadelphia. After graduating he joined a law firm and quickly made a name for himself in Philadelphia. During the rise of Tesla he was appointed by the UC government to investigate corruption within various Philadelphia based electric companies, and became known for his inpenetrable integrity. After finding great success in this field, he decided to join the political scene and joined the Federal Unionist Party."

PB_AME_Nicaragua_Occupation:0 "Nicaraguan Pacification Command"
PB_AME_Nicaragua_Occupation_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nNicaragua at this current time is an occupied nation. While it was originally to receive a generous 3% of canal profits, this was not enough for the Estrada government. With the consent of London, the Commonwealth armed a coalition of interned Dixie insurrectionists and turned them loose to topple Estrada. The decision has given us sufficient plausible deniability to effectively occupy the country, while using the insurrectionists as a cover. In Nicaragua, the people are increasingly unruly under American control, further complicating security around the Canal Zone. The American public is currently unaware of the extent of the occupation, but the bloodier things get and the longer the operation carries on, the more likely that someone catches on.\n\nCurrently, there are two active insurrectionist groups following the collapse of the Sandinistas in October. The §OZeledonistas§! represent the democratic opposition, primarily lead by the aging general Benjamín Zeledón.\nThe §bFederalistas§! represent a coalition of Central American generals, motivated by grand ambition and profit to restore the formerly unified Central American Republic.\n\nWe must stabilize Nicaragua by keeping both resistance factions from overtaking the American Occupation Administration. If §rDespotist popularity drops below 10%§!, Stephenson's government will be in danger of being §roverthrown§!. Should this happen, Nicaragua will break free and potentially attempt to re-occupy the canal zone, severely stalling progress.\n\n§YThe Stephenson Government's§! Popularity is currently at §Y[?NIC.party_popularity@ds|%]§!\n§OZeledonista§! Popularity is currently at §O[?NIC.party_popularity@lb|%]§!\n§bFederalista§!

PB_AME_Domestic_Policy_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Commonwealth's domestic policies are generally managed by supporting or discouraging particular interest groups. These groups maintain significant lobbying influence on their provincial and national parliaments, ergo keeping their favor is key for conducting the government as we desire. There are currently six major groups that hold influence in this manner.\n\nFreedmen represent the provinces primarily controlled by AfrRam groups, standing in opposition to the larger Southern lobby that controls most of the Old South.\n\nWarhawks represent the expansionist elements of the government, and keeping them empowered will allow us a freer hand in using force for diplomacy. Peaceniks, naturally, will attempt to restrain military action in diplomacy whenever possible.\n\nMegacorporations represent the influence of corporate groups on the Commonwealth, opposed by various trade unions. While the Unions lack the international influence of the Megacorps, they still represent a critical voting block for parliament.\n\n[get_freedmen_support]\n[get_freedmen_radicals]\n\n[get_dixie_support]\n[get_dixie_radicals]\n\n[get_warhawk_support]\n\n[get_peacenik_support]\n\n[get_megacorp_support]\n\n[get_union_support]\n"

PB_AME_The_Dawes_Ministry:0 "The Coolidge Ministry"
PB_AME_The_Dawes_Ministry_desc:0 "In 1931, the United Commonwealth held a general election to elect its new prime minister. The race was highly contested, with many strong candidates vying for the position. Ultimately, the people of the Commonwealth chose Calvin Coolidge as their new leader.\n\nCoolidge had previously served as the Governor of Vermont and then as the Deputy Minister under Prime Minister France. Viewed as a neutral candidate, Coolidge retains a strong policy of arbitration on the Commonwealth's unruly interest groups."
PB_AME_Double_the_Segregation:0 "Double Down on Segregation"
PB_AME_Double_the_Segregation_desc:0 "The segregation debate is one not worth wading into, for it’ll only dirty the reputation of our administration in fighting for either side. Therefore we will maintain a position of neutrality on the issue. Southerners and Freedmen may hate us for our noncommittal, and even aloof, stance but our voting base in the north will remain secure enough for us not to need their support.\n\nHopefully the fools will stop fighting soon…"
PB_AME_Maintain_Crittenden_Neutrality:0 "Maintain Crittenden Neutrality"
PB_AME_Maintain_Crittenden_Neutrality_desc:0 "With tension rising between the Freedmen and the White citizenry, many have called for us to step in. But they do not realise that we cannot do so, leaning too far one way would lead to disaster. Siding with the non-coloured citizens would spark race riots, possibly even rebellion. While siding with the Negros will cause the White citizens to use their economic influence to weaken our government, and could even spark conflict with New Dixie. So instead, we must walk the face, balance both sides and avoid any form of escalation. Some may call this cowardice, but the preferred term is appeasement."
PB_AME_Adress_the_Segregation_Issue:0 "Address the Segregation Issue"
PB_AME_Adress_the_Segregation_Issue_desc:0 "The armed conflicts between the Freedmen and White provinces are costing us greatly. Both financially and otherwise, despite the end of the Southern Rebellion in 1838. In the halls of government calls for action grow louder. We can no longer ignore them. But we shall not fight fire with fire, instead we shall take action to resolve the matter peacefully. We will sit down with those involved and hash out an agreement. Something that will not only ensure the stability of our Sothern territories but address the wider issue surrounding this conflict."
PB_AME_Addressing_the_Indian_Issue:0 "Revisiting Indian Policy"
PB_AME_Addressing_the_Indian_Issue_desc:0 "Dating back to the days of the first colonists in America, our relationship with the Native Indians has been a complex one. Today, they live on reservations. But some of the more liberal members of both our government and the one in London have called for us to rethink this approach and work to revive their culture.\n\nHowever, there are others who believe that we should instead focus on assimilation. While we do not know for sure what path to take, the Indian question is not something that can be ignored and sooner or latter we will have to give an answer."
PB_AME_Promote_Bi_Lingualism:0 "Promote Bi-Lingualism"
PB_AME_Promote_Bi_Lingualism_desc:0 "Language is key for the development of a people and their culture. It is morally imperative that we allow the Indian people to use their native tongue in their day to day administrative and educative work. That concept may be unpopular with some elements of our country, but those voices must be sidelined so that we may do what is right."
PB_AME_Discourage_Native_Language_Education:0 "Discourage Native Languages in School"
PB_AME_Discourage_Native_Language_Education_desc:0 "Maintaining native-language education has been more of a hindrance than a benefit, as programs to integrate the Indians into civilised society have long since stalled to a halt. Clearly more encouragement is needed for these tribes to embrace our way of life. All native-language media shall be defunded and replaced with English-only services, while in school native children will be discouraged in speaking their native tongue in and outside of the classroom. In time, there’ll be no-one left uttering anything other than the Queen’s English."
PB_AME_Develop_Haudenosaunia:0 "Develop Haudenosaunia"
PB_AME_Develop_Haudenosaunia_desc:0 "Haudenosaunia, more commonly known as the Seven Nations Territories, remains as one of the poorest regions in the north. The decentralised native government has been unable to meet the challenges of administering and modernising the disparate communities with traditional lifestyles remaining dominant, so it is only appropriate that we step in.\n\nTo incentivise new industry, grants will be given out to companies to invest and build in these regions. Combined with the natives acting as un-unionised labour, the venture will not only improve their lives but also be greatly profitable for those involved."
PB_AME_Develop_the_Seminole_Province:0 "Develop the Seminole Provinces"
PB_AME_Develop_the_Seminole_Province_desc:0 "East Florida is a unique case as it is the only majority native province in the entire Commonwealth, with many special provisions and laws that have allowed its tourist industry to thrive. Miami finds itself packed with visitors from all over the globe who come for the sunny beaches, casinos and cheap luxuries.\n\nHowever the swampy interior has been continuously neglected in favour of the coastal resorts. Poverty is rampant in interior communities, and combined with an epidemic of alcoholism have created a huge disparity between the two regions. With assistance from the central government the province will begin to bring the interior up to standard with the coast: local industries such as tobacco farming will be supported and mechanised, while new industries will bring the wonders of the modern age to the natives."
PB_AME_Native_Electrification_Bureau:0 "Establish the NEB"
PB_AME_Native_Electrification_Bureau_desc:0 "If the natives are truly to enter the 20th century we must bring the light of modernity to them, quite literally. Programs to provide wireless electricity to native regions have largely fallen flat under provincial oversight with local governors preferring to direct the funds toward their own settlements. Again, it is the duty of the central government to step in and guide them forward.\n\nThe creation of the Native Electrification Bureau will sideline the provincial governments to directly manage the construction of wireless electrical infrastructure and begin the phasing out of old wired systems. In time the natives will become fully integrated in all ways: culturally, administratively, and now infrastructurally."
PB_AME_Concessions_to_White_Provinces:0 "Concede to White Provinces"
PB_AME_Concessions_to_White_Provinces_desc:0 "The United Commonwealth has been facing increasing tension and unrest in its predominantly white Southern provinces. In an effort to quell these issues, the government has offered political and economic concessions to the region. The proposed concessions include greater autonomy for the provinces, tax breaks for businesses, and increased funding for infrastructure projects."
PB_AME_Concessions_to_Coloured_Provinces:0 "Reach out to Coloured Provinces"
PB_AME_Concessions_to_Coloured_Provinces_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Southern Rebellion a massive demographic shift occurred across the south, with Freedmen migrating en-masse to the Mississippi interior to form new communities away from the white terror. In time these became the coloured provinces of Bailey and Taliaferro, two lone bastions of loyalty in an otherwise hostile land.\n\nBut the provinces have remained an enigma since. The educated class of urban blacks has largely lorded over the rural descendents of field slaves in a strange recreation of the old plantation houses, only on a much bigger scale. While this system of governance is often derided as “despotic” it will allow us to mobilise the Freedmen voter base very efficiently in cooperation with local representatives. With a few subsidies here, a bunch of tax breaks there and we’ll soon have a fine political machine running."
PB_AME_Encourage_Linconia_Immigration:0 "Offer Marooner Recognition"
PB_AME_Encourage_Linconia_Immigration_desc:0 "Since the Negro Rebellion the Marooner Republic has been free from New Dixie's rule, but our government has been unwilling to recognise them as legitimate in fear of increasing tensions and potentially reigniting the southerners’ rebellious tendencies. But now it seems the facade cannot be kept up. As tensions between the two threaten to boil over into war, the possibility of a resurgent, hostile force from beyond the Mississippi becomes unignorable. As the lesser of two evils, we recognise the Marooners’ independence.\n\nAlthough the southerners will likely hate us for it, the large population of voting Freedmen will be pleased to see our passive support for the Marooner cause even if we have no commitment to provide aid. For now, this small victory will endear us greatly to them."
PB_AME_Carte_Blanche_for_the_White_Belt:0 "Carte Blanche for the White Belt"
PB_AME_Carte_Blanche_for_the_White_Belt_desc:0 "Violence is no stranger to the south, with honour killings and lynch mobs being a common form of justice where police presence is weak. While this disregard for law and order is despicable, many of our southern colleagues wish for us to turn a blind eye to these excesses in order for their continued support. For the time being we will accede to their demands.\n\nAs a precaution to any Freedmen protest, southern authorities will also be given special powers for a period. So long as they keep the peace, anything goes."
PB_AME_Expand_the_Coloured_Brigade_Program:0 "Increase Coloured Brigade Funding"
PB_AME_Expand_the_Coloured_Brigade_Program_desc:0 "While the coloured provinces maintain their own provincial guards there are currently no Freedman divisions in our armed forces, which is a great waste of potential manpower. Our administration will see to it that two Freedmen divisions are formed from the merger of these provincial forces and given adequate funding to be a fighting force equal to any other divisions in our army.\n\nThis historical first will be a great source of pride for many Freedmen, who's loyalty to the crown and the commonwealth will finally be recognised. With them on our side the southerners would dare not rebel again."
PB_AME_Repatriate_White_League_Prisoners:0 "Repatriate White League Prisoners"
PB_AME_Repatriate_White_League_Prisoners_desc:0 "The rebel state of New Dixie officially denies their support of the various insurgent groups that dot the south, but in truth they are the lynchpin of the entire anti-British movement. In order to maintain peace across the Mississippi we will agree to a series of prisoner transfers, with us returning interned White Leaguers while they release pro-civil rights agitators. Hopefully by extending the olive branch to them they will begin to wind down their activities in the south."
PB_AME_Increase_the_Southern_Development_Fund:0 "Increase the Dixie Development Fund"
PB_AME_Increase_the_Southern_Development_Fund_desc:0 "While we have provided some political concessions to the south, it has proven to not yet be enough. Calls for further action remain, the most immediate demands being from the rural population. They wish to see the economic development of the north replicated with them.\n\nTo ensure their support, we shall do so. By increased the Southern Development Fund, we will improve factories, farms and infrastructure across the entire region. By improving the lives of the rural southern population, we can practically guarantee their support. The improved economic output is a nice bonus too."
PB_AME_Promote_EIEC_Integration:0 "Promote EIEC Ventures"
PB_AME_Promote_EIEC_Integration_desc:0 "Edison Electric may have a disreputable standing in the eyes of those concerned with "moral issues", but there is certainly no denying their efficiency and industrial prowess. They may be profit-driven snakes, they may be questionable in their treatment of employees, but they are a definite boon to our economy... and that's what matters!\n\nBy granting special concessions, and promoting buyouts to them, we can provide a definite incentive for them to expand their business empire and prop up our partially ailing economy. It'll have no drawbacks we're told, but we must keep a watchful eye on them nonetheless."
PB_AME_Preferential_Contracts_EIEC:0 "Exclusive Contracts to EIEC"
PB_AME_Preferential_Contracts_EIEC_desc:0 "Our military is, for the most part, bound to the will of London. It is as well equipped as desired by His Majesty, and our capabilities from a standpoint of armaments can often be... lacking.\n\nHowever, Edison Electric is a fine loophole to this issue. While trusted by Britain, the EIEC hold no true loyalties to them and act in the name of profit, nothing more, nothing less. By further integrating the EIEC into our military-industrial complex we could benefit considerably and reduce our reliance on direct supply from London."
PB_AME_Expand_New_Jersey_Technical_Institute:0 "Expand the New Jersey Technical Institute"
PB_AME_Expand_New_Jersey_Technical_Institute_desc:0 "What finer source of intellect does a nation have other than its youth? Those young whippersnappers soak up knowledge like a sponge and, of course, this cycles back into our markets and government.\n\nThe Edison-founded New Jersey Technical Institute is one of the greatest points of cultivation we have for these brilliant minds. Expanding funding for the establishment will go a long way in improving our scientific standing in the Commonwealth, and let us not forget the international community."
PB_AME_Discourage_EIEC_Expansion:0 "Discourage EIEC Expansion"
PB_AME_Discourage_EIEC_Expansion_desc:0 "The EIEC has pushed our commonwealth too far! After playing games with our people for so long, we have had enough and will no longer tolerate it. We will break communication with the EIEC and do as we please, it may lead to competition with them, but we welcome the idea."
PB_AME_Promote_the_IBM_Alternative:0 "Support the IBM Alternative"
PB_AME_Promote_the_IBM_Alternative_desc:0 "The Imperial Business Machine is a worthy ally in our economic war against the EIEC. We are excited to prop up IBM as a viable alternative for technology. IBM itself is also quite excited and willing to work with us! After all, who wouldn't want to work with the United Commonwealth?"
PB_AME_Reignite_the_MegaCorp_Trade_War:0 "Reignite the MegaCorp War"
PB_AME_Reignite_the_MegaCorp_Trade_War_desc:0 "It has become overwhelmingly evident that our faith in the EIEC has been... misplaced, to say the least. But our righteous government isn't foolish enough to place all of our eggs in one basket. Having sufficiently subsidized other mega-corporations, we can simply bid off previous EIEC contracts to them and divvy out the allocations amongst our eager, wealthy patrons.\n\nLet the bidding begin!"
PB_AME_Edison_Mass_Electrification_Plan:0 "Edison Mass Electrification Scheme"
PB_AME_Edison_Mass_Electrification_Plan_desc:0 "While our cities and factories continue to prosper, the rural countryside has been neglected.

PB_AME_Embrace_Combined_Arms_Ability_desc:0 "During the Great War, chemical weapons were implemented in various ways. In the future, if chemical warfare were to occur again, it is likely that militaries would use gas masks and other protective equipment to minimize the impact of these weapons. Additionally, new forms of chemical weapons may be developed, potentially leading to more devastating effects. To combat this, new agents must be created that can circumvent enemy countermeasures and more effectively eliminate enemy forces."
PB_AME_Initiate_Cloning_Program:0 "Reactivate the Tuskegee Program"

Unicom.1.t:0 "The Automation Crisis hits America"
Unicom.1.d:0 "The Automation Crisis in the United Kingdom has spread to the rest of the Empire, hitting the Commonwealth particularly hard due to our reliance on the EIEC’s economic investments. Over a million people have almost instantly been put out of a job, including a number of American veterans.\n\nThe situation has lead to a dramatic breakdown of stability across the country as people campaign for the return of their jobs or even stage riots to attack automated factories, leading to conflicts with EIEC strikebreakers and the Pinkertons."
Unicom.1.a:0 "Get Edison representatives on the phone. Now."

Unicom.2.t:0 "Edison's Counterattack"
Unicom.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Coolidge was growing increasingly frustrated with the Edison Electric Company's automation policies, which were leading to widespread job losses and civil unrest. In a meeting with company representatives, he demanded that they slow down their implementation of automation and work with the government to mitigate the negative effects on workers.\n\nHowever, the Edison Electric Company was unwilling to compromise, arguing that automation was necessary for the company's long-term success and that they could not be held responsible for the social consequences. The meeting ended with both parties angry and no solution to the issue.\n\nCoolidge left the meeting feeling frustrated and powerless, as he knew that the government had limited power to regulate private companies. He realized that if he wanted to make any progress on this issue, he would need to find a different approach."
Unicom.2.a:0 "Smug bastards..."

Unicom.3.t:0 "Anti-Automation Riots"
Unicom.3.d:0 "Riots have broken out in cities across America as people take to the streets to protest the recent automation policies introduced by Edison Electric. The company's decision to replace human workers with machines has led to the loss of thousands of jobs, and many are now struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAnger and frustration have boiled over, and clashes between protesters and the police have become increasingly violent. Shops and businesses have been looted and destroyed, and the streets have descended into chaos. The government has been forced to intervene, but their efforts to restore order have so far been met with limited success. With tensions running high and tempers flaring, many fear that the worst is yet to come."
Unicom.3.a:0 "Deploy the Mounties, get these people off the streets."

Unicom.4.t:0 "The American Legion Mobilizes"
Unicom.4.d:0 "The Bonus Brigades, a group of American Great War veterans, have gathered in Philadelphia to demand the early release of bonuses promised to them by the government. The veterans, who have been struggling to make ends meet in the midst of the Automation Crisis, are determined to fight for what they believe is rightfully theirs. They have set up camp in the city, and their numbers are growing by the day.\n\nThe government, however, has been reluctant to release the bonuses early. Prime Minister Coolidge has argued that the bonuses should be paid on schedule, in 1945, and that releasing them early would set a dangerous precedent. He has also expressed concerns that the protest could turn violent.\n\nDespite these concerns, the Bonus Brigades remain determined to see their demands met. They have been holding peaceful demonstrations throughout the city, and have refused to leave until their demands are met. The situation remains tense, and many are worried that the protest could turn violent if a resolution is not reached soon."
Unicom.4.a:0 "Let's hear them out, at least."

Unicom.5.t:0 "General Butler endorses the Legion"
Unicom.5.d:0 "General Smedley Butler, a retired Marine Corps officer and outspoken critic of the government, has emerged as a prominent voice in the ongoing Bonus Brigade Crisis. In a recent speech, General Butler advocated for a peaceful solution to the crisis, calling on the government to honor its promises to the Bonus Brigades.\n\nGeneral Butler argued that the Bonus Brigades had every right to demand the bonuses promised to them by the government, and that the government had a moral obligation to pay them. He urged the government to avoid the use of force in dealing with the protesters, and instead to negotiate a settlement that would satisfy both sides.\n\nMany have praised General Butler's stance as a voice of reason in a time of crisis, while others have criticized him for advocating for what they see as an unjust demand. Nevertheless, General Butler's words have resonated with many Americans, and there is hope that his message of peace and reconciliation may help to bring an end to the crisis."
Unicom.5.a:0 "Tell him to keep his nose out of politics."
Unicom.5.b:0 "Butler and Currie are reasonable men, let's talk."

Unicom.6.t:0 "The American Legion Arrives in Philadelphia"
Unicom.6.d:0 "The American Legion delegation has arrived in Philadelphia, but with significant reinforcement. Nearly 20,000 demonstrators have flooded into the capital to support the delegation. While they generally aren't well armed, the RAMP have noted that many have significant wartime augmentation that could pose a threat to the public. Coolidge, now surrounded in his own country's capital by thousands of unemployed and angry veterans, now has to decide how to address the crisis.\n\nRouting the protestors would be deeply unpopular, but with the right media spin could be portrayed as defeating troublemakers. On the other hand, capitulation would make Coolidge look weak to the public and the Empire, and the UC may not be able to effectively foot the bill required. The third option, to negotiate, may be the best path for preventing bloodshed, but will require some compromises on both sides."
Unicom.6.a:0 "A decision must be made, and soon."

Unicom.7.t:0 "Addressing the Ministry of Indian Affairs"
Unicom.7.d:0 "The Coolidge administration has recently called upon the Ministry of Indian Affairs to address the issue of bi-lingualism versus an entirely English education curriculum for the United Commonwealth's Native American population. The debate has been ongoing for some time, with arguments from both sides weighing in on the matter.\n\nOn one hand, some officials argue that preserving bi-lingualism would help preserve the cultural heritage of Native American communities and provide a more inclusive educational environment. Others argue that a fully English education curriculum would be more practical and beneficial for the future success of Native American individuals in the broader society."
Unicom.7.a:0 "We should maintain the current bi-lingual curriculum"
Unicom.7.b:0 "Discourage Indian languages in favor of English"

Unicom.8.t:0 "Seminole Ministers protest policy changes"
Unicom.8.d:0 "Ministers from the Seminole Nation are protesting against the decision of the Coolidge administration to use a fully English educational standard in native American regions. The Seminole Nation, like many other Native American communities, values the preservation of their language and cultural heritage. The decision by the administration threatens to erode these important aspects of Seminole identity.\n\nThe ministers have argued that a fully English curriculum would lead to the loss of native languages and cultural practices, which have been passed down through generations. They have called for a preservation of bi-lingualism, arguing that it is essential to maintaining a strong sense of cultural identity and community.\n\nThe Coolidge administration, however, has defended its decision, citing the need for a common language to promote unity and communication within the broader United Commonwealth. The administration has also pointed to evidence suggesting that students who are educated in English have better academic outcomes and greater success in the job market.\n\nDespite the protests, the Coolidge administration appears to be committed to its position on this issue. It remains to be seen how this decision will ultimately impact the Seminole Nation and other native American communities throughout the United Commonwealth."
Unicom.8.a:0 "Perhaps we can make some exceptions..."
Unicom.8.b:0 "No special treatment, period."

Unicom.9.t:0 "Offering Concessions to Dixie"
Unicom.9.d:0 "In an effort to maintain their electoral support in the Southern provinces, the government of the United Commonwealth has offered a series of concessions to appease the concerns of Southern voters. These concessions include increased funding for infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridges, and additional resources for law enforcement agencies.\n\nCritics have expressed concern that these concessions could exacerbate existing regional tensions and perpetuate disparities between the North and South. However, supporters of the government's actions argue that these measures are necessary to ensure continued stability and prosperity for all citizens of the United Commonwealth."
Unicom.9.a:0 "Better a deal with the devil than nothing at all."

Unicom.10.t:0 "Offering Concessions to the Freedmen"
Unicom.10.d:0 "In an effort to maintain political support in the Southern provinces primarily populated by freed African Americans, known as Freedmen, the government of the United Commonwealth has offered a series of concessions.\n\nUnder the new concessions, the government has promised increased investment in infrastructure, education, and job training programs for Freedmen communities. Additionally, they have pledged to address longstanding issues related to housing discrimination, access to healthcare, and voting rights.\n\nCritics of the concessions argue that they are simply a ploy to maintain political power and do not go far enough to address systemic issues facing Freedmen in the Southern provinces. However, supporters argue that any progress is better than none and that the concessions represent a step in the right direction."
Unicom.10.a:0 "Let's keep things civil down south."

Unicom.11.t:0 "Freedmen Provinces protest Changes"
Unicom.11.d:0 "The concessions offered by the government have been perceived as a betrayal of the rights of Freedmen, who have long been fighting for greater political and social inclusion in the Commonwealth. The protests have been largely peaceful, but tensions remain high as the government faces growing pressure to address the concerns of the Freedmen and ensure that their voices are heard in the political process. The government has yet to respond to the protests, but it is clear that the issue will continue to be a major source of contention in the coming months."
Unicom.11.a:0 "I don't see how that's our problem."

Unicom.12.t:0 "Southerners Provinces protest Changes"
Unicom.12.d:0 "In a move to maintain their electoral support, the government of the United Commonwealth has announced that they will be offering concessions to the provinces primarily populated by freed African Americans, known as Freedmen. This has caused controversy among the Southern provinces who feel that they are being left out of the government's agenda. Several protests have been staged in the region, with residents claiming that the concessions are unfair and discriminatory towards their communities. The government has stated that they are committed to finding a solution that works for all citizens of the Commonwealth and will continue to work towards this goal."

Unicom.13.t:0 "Recognizing the Marooners"
Unicom.13.d:0 "In a historic move, the government of the United Commonwealth has offered diplomatic recognition to the Marooner Republic, a state that seceded from the Republic of New Dixie earlier this year. The Marooner Republic is primarily composed of descendants of enslaved Africans who have been living in the region for generations.\n\nThe decision to recognize the Marooner Republic has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters argue that it is a step towards recognizing the rights and autonomy of historically marginalized communities. However, some members of the government and residents of the Republic of New Dixie have criticized the decision as a violation of national sovereignty.\n\nThe United Commonwealth's offer of recognition includes the establishment of formal diplomatic relations and a commitment to support economic and social development in the region. The Marooner Republic has expressed gratitude for the recognition and hopes to build a peaceful and prosperous future for its people."

Unicom.14.t:0 "Repatriating Dixie's Insurrectionists"
Unicom.14.d:0 "The United Commonwealth government has announced that they will be repatriating militant insurrectionists who are supported by New Dixie back to their home state. The insurrectionists were discovered to be training and organizing in secret camps, with the aim of destabilizing the government and causing chaos. The government's action is seen as a strong statement of intent, as they aim to stamp out any potential threat to their national security.\n\nThese insurrectionists are a threat to our stability, and we need to decide what to do with them."

Unicom.15.b:0 "Are you serious? No."

Unicom.16.t:0 "New Dixie agrees to the Exchange"
Unicom.16.d:0 "In a surprising move, the government of the Republic of New Dixie has agreed to a prisoner exchange program proposed by the United Commonwealth. The exchange program involves the return of political prisoners currently held by the United Commonwealth to the Republic of New Dixie in exchange for the release of Commonwealth citizens held by New Dixie.\n\nThe program is seen as a significant step towards improving relations between the two nations, which have been strained in recent years. Many hope that this exchange program will lead to further cooperation and eventual peace between the United Commonwealth and New Dixie."
Unicom.16.a:0 "Surprising, but not unwelcome."

Unicom.17.t:0 "New Dixie refuses the Exchange"
Unicom.17.d:0 "New Dixie has refused the prisoner exchange program offered by the United Commonwealth. The program, which included the return of political prisoners held by the Commonwealth, was seen as a gesture of goodwill and a potential step towards reconciliation between the two nations. However, New Dixie officials cited concerns over the safety and security of the exchanged prisoners as the reason for their refusal. The decision has been met with disappointment by some Commonwealth officials, who had hoped that the program would help ease tensions between the two nations. It remains to be seen what further actions, if any, will be taken by either side in response to this development."

Unicom.18.d:0 "The Edison Electric Company has proposed a new rural electrification program to the Coolidge administration. This program aims to provide electricity to rural areas that are currently without it, in order to improve the standard of living for people in those areas.\n\nThe proposal suggests that the government should fund the program, which would involve the construction of power plants and transmission lines. The Coolidge administration has yet to make a decision on whether to approve the proposal, but experts believe that it has the potential to greatly benefit rural communities and the overall economy."

However, the company is now faced with a difficult decision on where to allocate the program's funding next. The focus has shifted towards determining whether to prioritize electrification in Southern or Freedmen states.\n\nAccording to sources within the company, officials are currently conducting feasibility studies and evaluating the economic and social impact of electrification in each region. While the program aims to bring electricity to as many people as possible, it is important to ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently.\n\nThe decision is expected to be made in the coming weeks, and many are eager to see which direction the program will take. The Edison Electric Company's rural electrification program has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for those in rural communities, and many are hopeful that it will continue to expand and bring progress to underserved regions."

Unicom.29.t:0 "Bonus Brigaders Arrested"
Unicom.29.d:0 "After receiving orders to negotiate, the RAMP was able to convince the Bonus Brigade hostage takers in Melbourne to stand down on the pretense that the government had given in to their demands. In truth, they were simply provided doctored information and were immediately arrested.\n\nWhile the incident has been de-escalated significantly, this still marks a dramatic shift towards violence on the part of the protests. No doubt, the brigaders will argue their case in the ministry courts, though most will likely not see the outside of a jail cell for some time."

Unicom.34.t:0 "A Killing in Melbourne"
Unicom.34.d:0 "An unidentified homeless man was found dead in the Melbourne lower sector this morning, apparently discovered by a group of local kids looking for scrap to recycle. The body is in poor condition, having been decapitated at some point in the last forty-eight hours. Medical examiners have also stated the body shows signs of ligature marks, indicating that the victim was likely bound and kept at a secondary location prior to the murder.\n\nOne notable detail is that the victim appears to have been a veteran, as his torso had faded identification tattoos that were made standard during the Great War. American forces often had difficulty identifying the dead in the trenches, and so torso identification tattoos became government policy shortly before the cessation of hostilities in Spain. Unfortunately, however, the tattoos were too faded to accurately discern due to a mix of weathering and integumentary damage during the killing. All this tells us is that the victim was a veteran, something not particularly in low supply thanks to the Bonus Crisis.\n\nThe killing has lead to a minor panic among Melbourne’s lower sector and retaliation attacks against local hobo camps are becoming a problem. The City’s police commissioner, Elliot Ness, has been tasked with attempting to resolve the murder before a double event can occur."
Unicom.34.a:0 "Start banging some heads together, we need leads."

Unicom.35.t:0 "The Melbourne Torso Killer Strikes Again"
Unicom.35.d:0 "The Torso Killer has struck again!\n\nAnother body was found in lower Melbourne today, this time in one of the public parks. A woman was found, decapitated and drained of blood, by a family on their way to a local church service. The body had suffered numerous stab and bludgeoning wounds, along with damage to arm and leg augmentations. The medical examiner subsequently identified the augmentations as consistent with civilian grade modifications provided to razormaidens when not in active service. It’s clear now that the killer is targeting veterans for whatever reason, a theory that Commissioner Ness has heavily pushed to his officers and detectives.\n\nA more radical idea has been proposed by the American Police Ministry, who argue that we should begin the process of criminally profiling the killer based on their modus operandi. The field of criminology, though relatively new, could prove to be exactly the edge we need in returning safety to the streets of Melbourne."
Unicom.35.a:0 "This is terrible!"

Unicom.36.t:0 "Two More Killings in Melbourne"
Unicom.36.d:0 "Another two victims were discovered in Melbourne earlier today, making this the first double event in the Melbourne Torso Killings. The victims, two local transients from the East Lower Sector, were discovered by two children on their way to school. The victims had been decapitated, their torsos stabbed multiple times and drained of blood. The only means by which they were identified was by their wartime identification tattoos, which indicated to the RAMP that the men were also veterans.\n\nIt's clear now that the killer is deliberately targeting vulnerable disenfranchised veterans, typically those displaced by the Bonus Crisis. Leads continue to be scarce, and civil authorities are urging the public to remain calm until the situation is back under control.\n\nPolice Commissioner Ness continues to involve himself heavily in the investigation, frustrated by the inability of the RAMP to catch the killer once again."
Unicom.36.a:0 "You've got to be fucking kidding me."

Unicom.37.t:0 "Potential Breakthrough in Melbourne"
Unicom.37.d:0 "The investigation in Melbourne has had a breakthrough!\n\nCriminal profilers have identified the killer as having a clear anti-veteran bias, but have also noted that stab wounds on the victims are consistent with combat training afforded to American Shock Troopers in the Iberian Campaign. Stab wounds are also consistent with the combat knives issued to these shock troopers, particularly serrations on several points within the stab wounds themselves.\n\nFollowing up on this, the RAMP indexed Commonwealth records for individuals who served within the American shock trooper forces during the war and turned up several results. Police have begun to work to locate the individuals mentioned within the system, and will report back results as they are found."
Unicom.37.a:0 "We might be getting somewhere."

Unicom.38.t:0 "Fourth Victim Identified"
Unicom.38.d:0 "The fourth victim was identified by the Melbourne Lower Sector Coroner as Martin Donaldson, a sharpshooter with the 85th shock trooper corps that served in the Iberian Campaign. After doing further research, we’ve uncovered that at least two of the other victims were also part of the 85th.\n\nThis draws a clear line to the potential identity of the killer, although police are still searching through Melbourne for further suspects.\n\nIt is notable, however, that the 85th was directly involved in the Siege of Valladolid and suffered significant casualties. Curiously, the army records on their involvement have all been heavily expunged or outright classified."

Unicom.39.t:0 "Dear Mister Ness..."
Unicom.39.d:0 "The letter stank, spilling droplets of blood on his desk. Ness looked around the office at the other officers, their expressions ranging from morbid curiosity to choking down vomit. It had arrived at the office with a private courier, paid in pounds and unable to say exactly who the original writer was. Untraceable, of course, because why make things easy on the investigation.\n\nHe slid the letter opener across the top and peeled it apart, unleashing the sickly-sweet smell of rot into the room. Officers backed away, a few running for garbage bins to vomit. Ness held his breath and reached a gloved hand into the envelope before dumping the contents onto his desk.\n\nA rotting human eyeball tumbled out, still dripping with congealed clotted blood. Ness could only guess which victim it had come from, the heads of the last two still hadn’t been found.\n\nThe letter within was smeared and shoddily written, but with some effort he could make out the words.\n\n“Dear Mister Ness, I’m sorry for what I did to those men, but you must understand the importance of my work. We need retribution for what we did, and once my work is completed you will receive my confession in full. An eye for an eye will make the world right.”"

Unicom.40.t:0 "Fifth Victim Identified"
Unicom.40.d:0 "A fifth victim was found this morning in Melbourne, this time dumped in the park just outside the Lower Melbourne Police Department. The message is clear, and obviously intended for Police Commissioner Ness. The body was once again lacerated multiple times, with the head removed with some kind of blunt object and the body drained of blood. Notably, the identification tattoos had several cuts around them in the shape of arrows, clearly meant to draw attention to the individual’s identity.\n\nThe man in question is Herbert Creely, an ex-officer within the 85th shock infantry corps that served in Iberia, just like the other identified victims. Creely was notably dishonorably discharged for inappropriate conduct during the siege of Valladolid, however like the other victims his records were expunged by Majestic Eleven.\n\nThe killer is either mocking us, or he’s trying to send a message."

Unicom.41.d:0 "The National News Hour, a program hosted by Edward Bowes, the call lines were opened for viewers to submit questions to that week’s interviewee. In this instance, neurology pioneer Walter Freeman attended the show to promote his new cutting-edge lobotomy procedures. Within ten minutes, an individual called into the show and announced himself as the Melbourne Torso Killer, and proceeded to describe to a bewildered Bowes his manifesto.\n\nAccording to the killer, the attacks are retribution for his unit’s actions during the Great War. He claims that during the battle of Valladolid, his unit conducted the mass killing of numerous surrendered Spanish troops and civilians. Before he could provide further information, however, Majestic Eleven agents stormed the building in force and shut down the program.\n\nCrucially, however, the caller remained on the line for just long enough for the police to get a rough idea of his location. He called from deep within the Lower Melbourne Industrial sector, and Commissioner Ness has gone along with a team to attempt to apprehend the killer before he can escape."
Unicom.41.a:0 "Track that phone call!"

Unicom.42.t:0 "Nothing but Ghosts"
Unicom.42.d:0 "As Ness and his officers arrived at the location of the phone call, they found nothing but an abandoned factory complex. The phone that was used to make the call was located, but the line was forcibly severed before they arrived.\n\nThere were signs of habitation, including opened cans of food and large piles of notes and military paraphernalia. The factory, which had previously been used for the packaging and shipment of canned goods, had been shut down a few months prior during the Automation Crisis.\n\nFew clues could be found, but for the time being it seems the killer has escaped our grasp.\n\nPerhaps, this time, forever."
Unicom.42.a:0 "The trail goes cold, perhaps forever"

Unicom.43.t:0 "Forward unto Hell"
Unicom.43.d:0 "The door slammed inwards as police stormed the abandoned factory complex. What had once been a simple packaging plant, shut down during the Automation Crisis, was now the personal headquarters of Ness’ target. As the police swarmed in, they quickly located a scrawny man attempting to flee out one of the broken windows. The man was clearly malnourished, but still muscular enough to put up quite the fight before he was cuffed, even biting the ear off one of the officers. Ness could only watch as the man thrashed on the dirty factory floor, only stopping once their eyes met. With a smile of crooked, broken teeth, he spoke.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if you’d make it, Mister Ness.” He rolled himself onto his belly to size up the Police Commissioner. His body was covered in cuts, at least a few hundred, each neatly lined up as though they were tally marks.\n\n“They don’t teach you fellas what we did in the war do they? You think they’d put that in the papers?”\n\nNess sneered, almost instinctively kicking the bound man in the stomach.\n\n“Shut your mouth, freak. You’re going straight to the goddamned chair if I have any say in it.”\n\nThe killer seemed unphased, he kept rambling on and on, his words becoming borderline incoherent.\n\n“Did they tell you about the church, guy? We rounded them all up, everyone was so tired, dog tired. They’d taken a potshot at us on the march up, cracked Johnny’s mask. There was still gas in the air, you know, invisible. Dead in an hour. We all watched it happen. We found the girl what did it, Nessie boy, and you know what they did to her?”\n\nThe Commissioner stood there, silent, the rest of the officers unsure of what to say.\n\nThe Killer started to shake, his knees buckling, he kept babbling in between bouts of tears and snot.\n\n“They cut her up bad, man. They cut her up and they had her, and then they shot up the whole church she was firing from. I watched them do it, I couldn’t do anything about it then, but I had to make things right. I had to make them pay, man. I had to. It weren’t right what we did back there.”\n\nSilence overwhelmed the room, only broken by the killer’s sobs and thrashing on the floor. After what felt like an eternity, Ness finally motioned for the other officers to carry the man outside, where he was regrettably surprised to find Majestic Eleven agents waiting dutifully nearby. They were above his pay grade, and thus there was little that he could do to stop them as they took the killer in toe and sent a cleanup crew into the factory."
Unicom.43.a:0 "Maybe there is no real justice."

Unicom.44.t:0 "The Trial of Carl McPherson"
Unicom.44.d:0 "The killer would be identified as a Mr. Carl McPherson, a former soldier and a veteran of the Iberian Campaign.

Thety argued that annexing Nicaragua would be a strategic move for the Commonwealth, citing the country's abundant natural resources and its strategic location between North and South America.\n\nOpponents of the proposal countered that the Commonwealth's military occupation of Nicaragua had already caused enough damage and that formal annexation would only further exacerbate tensions between the Commonwealth and the people of Nicaragua."

Someone hit him again, harder this time. His ears rang, he tasted blood, cold dirt met his face as he stumbled over himself. He reached into his jacket, frantically grasping for his service pistol. There was only time to fire off a single angry shot before it was knocked from his hand. The shot quieted the crowd, if only for a few seconds, another unseen layer of tension broken.\n\nOne of the rioters fell over, holding his neck as blood spilled out into the dirt. Moseley didn't have time to appreciate his marksmanship.\n\nThe crowd surged, years of trauma and anger spilling out like a burst dam, and the general sat in the epicenter. Moseley clawed, punched, kicked, fighting like a wounded animal as a hundred veterans overtook him.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they strung up his corpse from a streetlight, and turned their rage outward on the city."

This was his ship, and if anyone was going to go down with it, it may as well be him.\n\nGunshots echoed in the hall outside his office, followed by shouts and screams. Coolidge sighed, glancing back at the pistol on his desk. It would have been easier to end it, rob them off the satisfaction, or go down shooting. He cast those thoughts away, took a deep breath, and waited. If these hooligans wanted to go after the prime minister, they'd get him.\n\nThe uninvited guests didn't make him wait long. The oak door slammed open, fifteen men shoving their way into the modest office. The silence in the room seemed all consuming, all their bluster and confidence sapped away. For what felt like an eternity, they glanced amongst one another, then back to the Prime Minister. Finally, Coolidge's voice broke the silence.\n\n"You boys came here for the Prime Minister, and here I am."\n\nA few glances between the veterans, they shifted around uncomfortably.\n\n"Do what you feel you have to do."\n\nSlowly, almost ashamedly, the men raised their rifles.

Weeks of injections and subliminal broadcasts allow us to atrophy certain parts of the brain, making them suggestible to field commanders without harming motor functions.\n\nThere are, however, a subset of researchers interested in testing the limits of decanter intelligence. Though not officially supported, some of the researchers wish to see what might happen if a decanter were allowed to develop without lobotomization. It is theorized that this might allow them to draw on a sort of genetic memory inherited by their original iteration, potentially making them more useful as soldiers in the field.\n\nSuch an endeavor would be ethically questionable, though, and not officially supported by the Commonwealth government."

Patterson nursed a headache, holding a bag of ice to his blackened eye. For a month-old clone, Harlan could really throw a punch.\n\n“Sir,” he said “the lobotomized ones we’ve been combat training, they’ll follow their code phrases but they don’t fully understand the commands. I thought that maybe, nudge things in the right direction, a thinking rep might be more effective.”\n\nThe department head scoffed and took a long drag before flicking the cigarette away.\n\n“Do you know where your little freakshow might go, then?

Harlan had stumbled his way through the Melbourne colony, guided by the vague inclinations his mind offered him. After a few hours, he had finally arrived, standing outside an apartment door that felt overwhelmingly familiar in a way he couldn’t quite quantify. Nervously, he knocked his hand on it and waited.\n\nThe door creaked open, and before him stood a woman who was somehow both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. She looked exhausted, her eyes pitted with dark spots and her hair hanging loose. The two exchanged looks for a moment, wordlessly sizing each other up. She shook a bit, bracing herself against the doorframe.\n\n“H-Harlan, what-“\n\nHer breath caught in her throat, she felt dizzy. Before Harlan could react, she nearly collapsed to the floor, sobbing. He reached a hand out to rest it on her shoulder, but she brushed it off, scrambling backwards into the apartment.\n\n“You’re not real,” she shouted, “I buried you!”\n\nHe tried to say something, anything, but his words kept failing to come out. Finally, after a moment of silence interspersed with tears, he finally spoke.\n\n“Ma’am, I don’t know who you think I am.

This wasn’t her husband, or perhaps it was, or perhaps it was some kind of Homunculus pretending to be him. It was convincing enough at least. When Harlan had finished, she sat quietly for a moment, then, reached for a photo on the kitchen counter. It was their wedding photo, eight years before he’d died.\n\n“I don’t understand,” she said.\n\n“That makes two of us,” Harlan said with a pained smile.\n\nShe turned back towards him, sizing Harlan up. He was a near exact copy, down to the most minute detail. A second chance, perhaps, at having her husband back again.\n\n“Are you going to stay, this time?”\n\nThe question caught Harlan off guard, and he paused for a moment to think it over. If the people who made him knew about his memories, they’d come here, and if they did, they might hurt her as well. She was a stranger, but she was his wife, or at least that’s what his memories told him. Before he had time to answer, the door shook with a knock once more. He motioned for Leanne to open it, ducking into the kitchen.\n\nThe door crashed open as a group of masked soldiers stormed inside, flanked by a man in a white lab coat. Leanne was quickly thrown to the ground and detained, screaming and begging them not to take her husband away again. It didn’t take long to find Harlan, and he was drug out into the living room and knelt before the doctor.\n\n“You had to know someone would come along, Harlan.” Patterson said, glancing at his misplaced clone. Harlan scowled, spitting in the doctor’s face before a soldier clocked him over the head with a pistol. Blood flowed freely from his head as he rolled in pain, Leanne still screaming at them. Patterson turned to the offending soldier, motioning for him to stand down. The masked man stepped back in an almost robotic fashion, leaving Patterson to deal with Harlan.\n\n“Just take me, Doc, leave her out of this. She doesn’t know anything.

Once more, Leanne begged him to stay, saying they had a second chance, that he couldn’t just leave her again, not after she’d had a chance to see him. He embraced her, and then he had to break her heart again.\n\n“I’m sorry, but I’m not the man you married. I didn’t know him, and I don’t know if I could be him.”\n\n“But”\n\n“If I stay here, more people are going to come looking. They’re going to come after you, and they’re going to kill you or worse. I can’t let that happen.”\n\nShe shook her head frantically, sobbing into his shoulder. The second chance had come and gone, and a future where she’d been able to hold her husband slipped from her fingers.\n\nThe goodbyes were short and simple, and with that Harlan stepped back outside, giving a quick nod to the Doctor as he left. Patterson watched his creation slip away into the Melbourne crowd and sighed. If that Harlan was lucky, he might be able to slip the border and head West. He’d be able to disappear, become just another freak in the freak kingdom across the Mississippi.\n\nFor now, though, all he could think about was the amount of paperwork he’d have to do once he got back to the office, and how he’d explain how a wayward decant had slipped the net."

Harlan tried to scream, but he was cut off by another bullet, this time in the head.\n\nBy the time the Commonwealth authorities became involved, the incident had come under Majestic Eleven jurisdiction.
