 ASK_Vasily_Korzh_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 01/13/1899\n\n§YVasily Korzh§! was born into an impoverished peasant family in Belorussia. Living in the intense poverty of Tsarist Russia, he was forced to grow resourceful from an early age. Tragedy seemed to follow him like a specter, as his father would be drafted and subsequently killed during the Great War. Not long after, the arrival of the Great Pestilence ended his mother's life, along with most of his village.\n\nVasily would spend the 1920s as a ward of the state, raised by the increasingly ultranationalist Russian government. After turning eighteen, he joined the Imperial Russian army, just in time to witness the collapse of the postwar European economy and the Long Depression. Ultimately, he would return to his homeland of Belorussia not as a visitor, but as a conquerer. Deployed to the region to quell nationalist unrest, he gained infamy among the military for his brutality in crushing a series of bread riots in Minsk. It would be this brutality that earned him a position within the Okhrana.\n\nAs time passed and Russia fell further into ultranationalist revanchism, Korzh found himself with a new assignment in the colony of Novorossiya. The colony had become, essentially, a dumping ground for political undesirables, earning it the nickname of the Prison State. Vasily now rules the colony with a begruding iron fist, believing his reassignment to be a politically motivated move due to his non Russian heritage. Being the Empire's warden may not be the most engaging work, but it does at least pay the bills."
 BAL_Anton_Denikin_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 16/12/1872\n\nBorn in the Warsaw Governate of the Russian Empire, now part of Congress Poland, §YAnton Denikin§! is a man of little compromise. Driven by his father's patriotism and religious faith, he would join the Imperial Russian Army and ultimately see combat on the Far Eastern Front of the Great War. It was in this storm of steel that Denikin would make his name, helping to lead a daring assault on Seoul during the collapse of the Japanese front.\n\nIn the intervening years, Denikin became a vocal proponent of the Russian ultranationalist Bratsvto party. This came in conjunction with his deployment to the Western provinces during the 1920 Nationalist Rebellions, which saw Russia's Westernmost territories erupt in secessionist fervor. Denikin served with distinction in the defeat of the Baltic Partisan forces and would later command troops during the calamitous Finnish Offensive.\n\nYears have passed since then, and now Denikin rules the Baltic Governate, officially the Baltic Autonomous Provinces. In reality, the Baltics are Denikin's personal fiefdom, ruled with a level of despotic ferosity that would shock even the brutal colonial regimes of Africa. Civil rights are nonexistent, mass killings are rampant, and Denikin has made it his personal mission to rid the Baltic of supposed Jewish-German influences. Denikin is one of the most fervent supporters of the Moscow regime, and will gladly raze the Baltics to the ground if it would mean furthering the ambitions of Mother Russia."
 TRS_Nikolai_Yudenich_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/7/1862\n\n§YNikolai Nikolayevich Yudenich§! was born to a minor court official in Moscow, where he would later graduate from the Alexandrovsky Military College in 1881. During the Great War, Yudenich would serve during the Manchuria Campaign, an unofficial front in the war oft regarded as an illegal occupation by most historians. This campaign was largely an effort by Imperial Russia to squash nascent pro-Japanese elements in Manchuria while also securing the region's agricultural base and serving as a springboard for the invasion of Japanese-occupied Korea.\n\nLike many generals, Yudenich spent much of the Interwar fruitlessly attempting to justify and explain the military blunders of the Far Eastern Front. Again, like many generals, he found himself forced to turn his army's weapons on his own countryment during the 1920 Rebellions. For Yudenich, his actions in the pacifications remain a wound on his psyche. A wound that festered and ultimately drove Yudenich into a deep depression.\n\nWhile normally this would just be another tragic story of psychological breakdown, the key problem is Yudenich's appointment as Viceroy of the Caucuses precisely because of his efficiency in partisan suppression. Yudenich's depression and seclusion has paralyzed the Caucasus government, leaving the Russian administration barely capable of keeping the region under control. Day and night, Yudenich remains either in his office or, increasingly as of late, infirm in bed. The old man remains the only thin fiber holding the rebellious mountains from being set alight once more."
 
 GER_Georg_I_Desc:0 "Emperor of Austria, Emperor of the United Kingdoms of Germany, King of Bohemia, Apostolic King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Lodomeria and of Illyria, King of Jerusalem and so forth. Archduke of Austria, Duchess of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola, Margrave in Moravia, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n§YBorn:§! 2/4/1880\n\n§YGeorg Franz Joseph Luitpold Maria Prinz von Bayern§! is the eldest son of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and Archduchess Gisela of Austria. Reportedly the favored grandson of Kaiser Franz Joseph, Prince Georg would enter the Deutsches Heer in 1897. During his time serving under the Heer, he would take part in multiple engagements across the Western Front in the French and Italian theatres. Most notably, his Bavarian cavalry unit would take part in the third Battle of Vittorio Veneto, one of the bloodiest battles of the Great War's European theatre.\n\nIn the years since the conflict, he would go on to marry Archduchess Isabella of Austria and spent the majority of his time studying theology. With the abdication of Kaiser Rudolf, however, Georg's ties to the Austrian Royal family granted him a tenuous chance at the throne. Pressured by King Rupprecht of Bavaria, Georg's gambit has paid off and earned him the title of Kaiser. Whether or not he will remain a puppet of Rupprecht's ambitions or not remains to be seen."
 
 BFE_Charles_Wingate_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 2/26/1903\n\n§YOrde Charles Wingate§! is the ultimate example of British adaptability in the Far East. Born in Bishnupur, Manipur, Orde was the eldest of three sons in a military family. His father Colonel George Wingate retired from the army in late 1905, but found himself called back into service following the outbreak of the Great War. Orde Wingate spent much of his youth being educated within the Calcutta administration's school system, which controversially maintained a whites only policy until the 1918 Calcutta Indian Rebellion.\n\nFollowing the Great War, George Wingate and his family emigrated to Singapore after acquiring a minor administrative position in the newly formed Far East Administration. Orde, young and drunk on tales of imperial adventure, soon after joined up with the British Expeditionary Mission in Vietnam. Here, he would cut his teeth leading daring raids against Indochinese insurgents who refused to acknowledge their liberation by the British Empire. Demonstrating his competency in jungle warfare, Orde would spend much of the interwar helping in the pacification of Cambodia, as well as leading expeditions into Southern Borneo to prop up the failing Dutch East Indies.\n\nWingate's jungle adventurism would ultimately lead him to the position of Governor General following the assassination of Governor General Dobell by Vietnamese terrorists. Increasingly eccentric, Wingate's lack of professionalism has become a problem for many within the FEA, and his constant insistence on leading the troops against the Vietnamese insurgents has forced many of his duties on to local Sultans and Far East Admiral Lord Mountbatten, the latter of which has become gradually less willing to tolerate Wingate's shenanigans."
 BAF_Evelyn_Baring_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 8/29/1903\n\n§YEvelyn Baring§! is the son of Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, the so-called \"Maker of Modern Egypt\". Graduating from Oxford University, Baring bounced between various Foreign offices across the Empire in the tumultuous years after the Great War. Ultimately, he found himself appointed as Governor General of the British African Administration, a vast African colony spanning from the coast of Algeria to Dahomey and the Nigerian territories.\n\nThe vastness of the land has been both its' boon and its' undoing, as Britain took over the administration of the entirety of France's North African colonies. Many of these misguided Africans came to believe that liberation might mean independence, and now agitate across the colony for autonomy or outright revolution. Into this, Governor General Baring has taken to administrating the colony with an iron fist, wielding his colonial forces to crush any resistance. Under Baring, British Africa has come to be lead by the creed of the White Man's Burden. Those willing to collaborate with their British overseers are rewarded handsomely, and those unwilling to are destroyed with incredible violence. Concerns about the treatment of the Africans have been raised by British citizenry, but Baring has consistently reaffirmed his stance that he has been sent here to deliver civilization to the savages, and will continue to do precisely that."
 SWK_Vyner_Rajah_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 8/26/1874\n\n§YCharles Vyner Brooke§! is the third White Rajah of the Raj of Sarawak. The son of Charles Brooke, Vyner was educated in Britain and served incognito in the Royal Navy during the Far Eastern Naval Campaign. Shortly thereafter he would marry Sylvia Brett, the daughter of Great War general Reginald Brett, and return to Sarawak to be crowned following the death of his father.\n\nVyner's reign has overseen a myriad of reforms to the public service and an expansion of the Raj's importance in the British sphere. A booming oil and rubber industry have lead Sarawak to become the jewel of the British Far East. His hands-off rule has fostered a degree of genuine popularity with the local population, however there is significant pressure from the Council Negri to relinquish more of his powers to a constitution. While the Rajah has resisted this constitutionalist pressure for some time, the resurgence of a Pan-Asianist Japan playing pied piper to would be revolutionaries across the region may force him to embrace constitutionalism and further local autonomy."
 HNK_Alfred_Vanderbilt_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 10/20/1877\n\n§YAlfred Gwynne Vanderbilt§! is the third son of Cornelius Vanderbilt II and a member of the prestigious Vanderbilt family. While American in origin, the Vanderbilt dyanasty has propelled itself to prominence throughout the Empire through their monopolies on American railroads and the shipping industries. In a predominantly naval empire, the Vanderbilt shipping monopoly grew exponentially off inter-imperial trade and by the 1900s there was a Vanderbilt steamship line or railway in nearly every single British colony and commonwealth on Earth.\n\nInto this financial fiefdom came Alfred Vanderbilt, who succeeded his father following his death in 1899. Receiving the bulk of his father's estate, Alfred began touring across the Empire to expand the enterprise and study the steamship designs of competitors. The outbreak of the Great War brought incredible opportunity for the company, with Alfred buying out American shipyards and scooping up lucrative warship contracts from throughout the Commonwealth.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Great War, Vanderbilt would move throughout the Empire and continue expanding his interests. Ultimately this would land him in Hong Kong, where his extensive involvement in Chinese railway and steamer construction would garner him major influence in the province. Building off this influence, Vanderbilt manuevered his way into being appointed governor of Hong Kong, securing one of Britain's finest ports for one of its' finest magnates. Vanderbilt's control of Hong Kong is largely conducted via economy, using his wealth and influence to keep things profitable and efficient. However, with revolutionary fervor growing in China, it seems likely that Chinese nationalists will soon turn their attention to his bustling metropolitan fiefdom."
 BEF_John_Pershing_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 9/13/1860\n\n§YJohn Joseph Pershing§! is one of the most well-respected Americans in the British Empire. Born to John Fletcher Pershing and Ann Elizabeth Thompson, Pershing would be exposed to the military from an early age and would be sworn in to the Thomas Gage Military Academy in 1882. Petitioning the Royal Army for active duty, he was deployed during the American Indian Wars, which drove the remaining rebellious Native American tribes in the Commonwealth West into the frontier.\n\nPershing was most notably deployed during the Boxer War, working alongside British and Japanese troops to relieve the Beijing Legations. His bravery and leadership skills during the Boxer War saw him through the ranks of the Royal American Army, leading to his promotion to General in 1903. Pershing would go on to lead the Royal American Army through engagements throughout the Iberian Campaign, and he is attributed as one of the first Anglo-American generals to use the flag of the United Commonwealth instead of the Union Jack in battle. He faced criticism for his scorched earth tactics during the conflict, as well as for his support for a British intervention in Spain following the civil war and Treaty of Madrid.\n\nPershing was later appointed as Governor General of the British East Africa Protectorate, largely due to his experience in fighting guerillas in his early career. His leadership of the colony has been marked by considerable change, as Pershing has attempted to transform the region into a \"little America\" by populating his regime with Americans and couching his mission there in \"American values\". Whether or not his Americanization of the colony can succeed remains to be seen, but some in Britain have concerns that his loyalty lies more with Philadelphia than London."

 PB_UBICO_I:0 "It doesn't matter when: during coffee time, while watching a parade or when talking to the important men of the Royal Fruit Company. Ubico I, first emperor of Guatemala and its people, will always bring up his resemblance to his idol, the great Simón Bolívar. In the emperor's eyes, Ubico shares the tactical genius, the political mind and respect for the people as the man that liberated South America from Madrid's oppression and established a royal dynasty in Colombia. His comparisons to Bolivar have become a habit that many of Ubico's close allies have become used to, even if they have to bite on their tongue when the comparisons turn into grand displays, including statues and paintings of Bolívar and Ubico in similar poses. \n\nUbico hasn't always been the dictator of tropical Guatemala, being the son of a lawyer-politician who climbed through life via the military. With the support of the Guatemalan military and financial backing from Royal Fruit, Ubico was able to overthrow Guatemalan democracy and install a military dictatorship, before proclaiming himself the Emperor of Guatemala. In response, the Republic of Los Altos started their revolutionary campaign against Ubico's reign, with the conflict continueing to this day, though with more restrain than the first months of the war. Nevertheless, raids and pillaging of local villages may be damned, as long as Ubico rules Guatemala like the little emperor he is."

 AGUIRRE_DESC:0 "While Luis de Arana y Goiri may have been the first president of the Basque country after its independence in 1917, Aguirre is what most would recognise as the true \"Father of Euskadi\". A relative outsider to politics before joining the CNV in the '20s, having ran his family chocolate business during the Great War and maintaining a short career in Basque football, Aguirre would be the wonderchild to build upon the CNV's legacy and give it new purpose after Basque independence had been won. Under his leadership, the CNV won the election of 1927 against the EAE and gave form to a proper christian-democratic party. \n\nSince then, the Aguirre government has followed up on its promises of a caring and prepared state. The Basque country's HDI increased above Spain, Portugal and France with the introduction of the basic Basque welfare scheme and the national healthcare provisions. At the same time, Aguirre introduced a mandatory conscription period for all men of fighting age in 1931 as a way to bolster the reserves, fearing the increasingly revanchist and irredentist tones from Paris and Madrid. These ideas may accumulate into a true threat to the Basque people and their way of life. It will take a lot of effort for Aguirre to defend this country, this house of his father, against wolves, drought, usury and justice."

 ENG_Queen_Victoria_Desc:0 "§YQueen Victoria§!, born Alexandrina Victoria, is debatably one of the oldest living human beings alive, though some treasonous luddites might try to dispute the human part. Ascending to the throne in 1837, Victoria would reign over the British Empire throughout its' pivotal evolution during the 19th Century. In particular, her private support of the abolition cause in the United Commonwealth played a role in the ultimate end of the practice in British North America. Marrying Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Queen would act as something of an impartial observer in Imperial politics, using the rotating residency of the royal family to win support from the Constituent Commonwealths.\n\nIn 1894, her life would change forever when Charles J Guiteau fired three shots at her while attending a a speech by then American Prime Minister Neal Dow. Historians debate the exact reason for Guiteau's attack, as Guiteau himself was gunned down by the Royal American Mounted Police shortly after fleeing. Victoria suffered two gunshot wounds and was rushed to a nearby hospital to undergo treatment. The Queen's condition was stabilized the following morning and representatives of Edison Medical, a branch of the Edison Electric Company, approached the Queen and royal family with a radical untested treatment. Victoria agreed, over the protests of her consort, and underwent an eighteen hour surgical procedure. She emerged as one of the first human beings to survive surgical augmentation and organ transplantation, a living triumph of Imperial technical prowess.\n\nThough less of a public figure after the death of Prince Albert, the Queen nonetheless remains a pillar of the British Imperial mythos. As time goes on, however, and her children and grandchildren come of age, it has become clear that they may never see the throne in their lifetime as long as she persists. Acutely aware of this, the Queen and her loyalists opted to offload most of them to the colonies as governor-generals or advisors, fearing that court intrigue would be a destabilizing force.\n\nAs the lights across Europe dim once again and America seeks their own path, the ever present Empress Eternal remains. To some, an image of §Ghope§! and technological progress. To others, a grim portend of a future immortal aristocracy, a humanity without humanity, ruling from this day until the §Rend of days§!."

 PB_AME_Calvin_Coolidge_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 7/4/1872\n\n§YCalvin Coolidge§! is one of the more enigmatic Prime Ministers in American history. Succeeding Elihu Root as the leader of the Federal Unionist Party in 1919, Coolidge maintained a hands off approach to parliamentary politics for much of his career. Initially elected as Governor of the Province of Vermont, Coolidge maintained a staunch policy of fiscal conservatism. In this regard, he found significant success in establishing the New England Regional Budget Management Committee, leading the member provinces to the first multi province budget surplus in American history. His streak of stumbling into success nearly ended when his son was hospitalized with sepsis, however the illness was resolved and Coolidge returned to politics with a renewed vigor.\n\nCoolidge's insistence on economic regulation lead to generous support from local businesses and megacorporations, eventually leading him to be appointed Prime Minister following the 1927 parliamentary elections. De-regulation and budget management became a critical part of his administration, dramatically expanding business freedoms at the cost of labour laws and unions. This fostered a period of dramatic economic growth, sometimes referred to as "Coolidge Prosperity".\n\nThis prosperity came with a price, however, as de-regulation allowed megacorporations like the EIEC to monopolize whole swathes of American industry. While some might believe the EIEC is simply too big to fail, others have warned that the monopolization of America's economy could have dire consequences should Edison falter, let alone fall.\n\nAs 1933 dawns, however, there is a looming sense of finality to Coolidge's leadership. A heart attack in the spring of 1931 required invasive heart surgery and subdermal augmentations, with the Prime Minister's physicians advising him to begin looking at retirement in the near future lest his heart give out again."
