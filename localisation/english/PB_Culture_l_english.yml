### CULTURE DESCS
english_desc: "The English culture reaches from the cold skies of the British Isles to the almost blizzard like terrain of the north American winter lands, to the artificial lakes of Africa and beyond it seems nowhere in the world is there not at least one fine English gentleman parading across the street. While English culture has remained largely true to its early 19th century form noticeable changes have emerged. Namely the quick progression into more liberalistic beliefs, and a strange yet captivating interest into indoor domestic life; this can be attributed to the beginnings of the multilevel structure of London that has slowly spread across the English countryside. If one was to define the modern English man in only a few words, then there would be none better to choose from than civilized and sophisticated."

scottish_desc: "The Scottish people are one of hard work, dedication, and patriotism. Their valiant efforts in the First Great War have never gone unseen by the British nobility, serving proudly amongst their English and Irish Brethren during Operation Overlord. However, not everything is sunshine and rainbows, the Scottish people have longed for an independent homeland ever since the unification of Great Britain. Whilst there have not been any relatively major attempts at succession from Imperial Britain all it would take is for London to push the Scots far enough for their tamed patriotism to alight once more."

londoner_desc: "The British Empire stands at the precipitous of forever changing the fundamental operation of global society. Slowly cities across the world reach for the heavens and the interpretation of the great social divide between classes becomes quite literal. Lower sectors of these high rise cities are left to the poorest of the poor, or in London's case, being completely abandoned by any form of central authority.\n\nLondoners are partially different from their English counterparts, their society is one of indoor life and libertine values. Only the richest individuals enjoy even standard doses of sunlight, with the rest of the Londoner population suffering from severe vitamin D deficiencies. However, even the poorest Londoners typically enjoy a better standard of living then those found it whatever remains of the London countryside. London itself is a fascinating concoction of victorian highrise architecture and experimental technologies. In some ways London and its population have truely reached the limits of human social development, for better or for worse. "

# FRANCE #

breton_desc: "To the northwest of France the last Celts in mainland Europe dwell.  After hundreds of years of forced homogeneity with the French, the Bretons gained their independence after the French surrendered and with that formed a second Breton state.  The Bretons are currently going through a cultural renaissance; with the Breton language seeing a record number of speakers and new art and literature coming from the peninsula, it seems the last mainland Celts have finally secured their existence.  However, the neo-imperialist government to their southeast has been threatening them as of late, and with French revanchism on the rise, some can’t help but think the Breton renaissance’s days are numbered."
french_desc: "The French people used to be considered by some as the most prestigious and romantic of Gods great children. Even the typical Anglo family would dream that someday they would be able to travel to the city of Paris, however such feelings no longer hold true. France is seen by many as a nation with a peoples in perpetual decline. Nothing but a European backwater. One can't blame these critics though, week after week for the last twenty or so years reports of financial crash, rising unemployment, and riots would become almost commonplace. But change has finally gripped France, for better or worse. The regime in Paris seems to have stabilized the situation and now France and its people are fast on track to rival both Germany and Britain. Time will tell though whether they will return to their historical status as a European Great Power, or even surpass it. "
occitan_desc: "For hundreds of years, the Occitan people have suffered persecution and forced integration with their French rulers.  From the Albigensian Crusade to the founding of France’s neo-imperialist government, the Occitans have dealt with much.  However, this has not shattered their spirit; they continue on with their long-lasting traditions and unique Mediterranean language, keeping the Occitan torch held high amongst the darkness of French chauvinism.  They refused to be silenced, and as such provide plenty of problems for France’s governing neo-imperialists in the form of light armed resistance and protests.  Even then, some have found shelter from the revanchists in Catalonia, Italy, and Algeria, meaning even if the French manage to win, the Occitans will live on forever."

Not only are they a people of conquering, but also of mercantilism, trade, birthplace of modern capitalism, and the founding place of the first ever Republic, which has forever changed the political landscape on the European continent.

It can be best described as mitch match of French, German and Dutch culture, and some parts even having some Luxembourgian culture. Having gained their independence quite recently in 1910 after the Great War, the country was in ruins, but the people of Wallonia managed to not only rebuild the country, but also foster unity amongst there newly independent citizens. The creation of the Wallonian state can be credited to the governments of the imperial powers, who the idea of a buffer state between both France and the Netherlands. They are also the reason that Walloon is the only official language in the country, which was achieved through their anti-French agenda. The people are known too be very friendly, mercantile and most helpful when it comes to most things."

brandenburg_prussian_desc: "The cultural identity of Prussia is somewhat split between those who live in the Independent State of Prussia, and those who stay within the Confederation. This latter group has become known as 'Brandenburg Prussians' or 'West Prussians' in reference to the Brandenburg province that most of them reside in. Despite the border that separates them, many cultural features of Prussia remain. They are a very militarised culture, many looking upon the Prussian army both a Germanic heroes but also possible liberators within some more nationalistic circles. They also possess a respect for a strong central authority, once again born out of the instilled respect for the military and by extension one's superiors. Their exposure to the urban centres of cities such as Berlin has also fuelled an industrialist mentality, with many Brandenburg Prussian businesses running their factories in a high effective and centralized manner. Though willing to accept technological change, to an extent, many Brandenburg Prussians are also found to be very traditionalist and conservative in their goings on. Often only willing to accept the smallest of cultural reform, this mentality being the result of the rigidness of Prussian society. Indeed, many Brandenburg Prussians do not see themselves aligned with the Confederation, instead looking toward their independent neighbours. And as the years go on, calls for independence and reunification with Eastern Prussia become increasingly loud. "
east_prussian_desc: "With Prussia being an independent state, completely separate from the German Confederation, the population has begun to develop its own cultural identity. These people are known unofficially as 'East Prussians', not to be confused with the Brandenburg Prussians who remain in the German Confederation. Having been independent from the Confederation for some time, many East Prussians views themselves as somewhat separate from the rest of Germany. That's not to say they share no cultural ties to the rest of the nation, such as a common tongue, they simply emphasise their differences. Prussia maintains a highly militarised culture, with most important secular historian figures being military commanders or conquerors, such as Fredrick the Great. Military service in general is views through a lenses of honour and a proud history of military victories. Though somewhat more agrarian then their Brandenburg Prussian cousins, both groups share a conservative and traditionalist outlook on society. Believing that changes to the Status Quo would risk losing their heritage. Despite their indepedent nature, many East Prussians, especially within nationalistic circles, believe that the liberation of the Brandenburg Prussians is inevitable. And there are rumours, that the military is taking this sentiment to heart."
hanoverian_desc: "Hanoverian culture is a unique Germanic culture. Born in the north of Germany, the people of Hanover are a distinctly protestant and British influenced subgroup of Germans. With the ascension of George I in the early 1700's, there have been cultural and economic ties between Hanover and the United Kingdom. Political ties between the two however were severed with the ascension of Queen Victoria. With political severance between the two, the Hanoverian people were left to fend for themselves, and thusly when Austria came knocking on the door of the Hanoverian people, they simply whimpered and let in the Austrian wolves. Since unification, Austria has attempted to connect the people of Hanover more closely to the union of German states."

Wielding a highly influential vote on matters in the Holy Roman Empire, Saxony was keen on maintaining that power to tip scales inside Germany. The German unification presented problems for the old elites, as they were poised to be outshined and made irrelevant. In spite of backroom politics, the Saxon political elite could not destroy the will of the people. Saxony became a part of Germany. Now Saxons enter a new age with bated breath.\n\nThe Saxon culture is one of fierce patriotism, their flag, customs, and food are seen as some Germans as the true origin of the Germanic culture. "
south_german_desc: "Southern German cultures are a weaving set of different yet similar groups with the most successful south German culture being Austrian, and due to this have always been looked at as the lesser in the cultural union between Austria and the rest of the Southern German groups. Austria has had a large success in assimilating the cultures of the south into being more aligned with Austria and its will.  In spite of this there are those who push to keep the culture alive, and to keep the spirit of the south Germans burning. Bavarian being the most widely celebrated German culture and a sign against Austrian hegemonic cultural influence in the south."

However the ramifications of the war reinforced neutrality as a core principle of the swiss people, the bloodshed that changed the world left Switzerland the same as it was before, however times have changed and a new order threatens again to wildly change the balance of Europe and the globe."

Having moved east as part of the old Ostsiedlung phenomenon, in which German settlers moved east from central Germany during the Middle Ages, the Sudeten Germans are a populous minority in Bohemia, making up 23% of the population in the region.  With them they brought the German language and culture, making the mountains their home.  The Sudeten Germans are a point of contention between nationalists, with German nationalists supporting the integration of the Sudetenland into Germany proper, and Czech and pan-Slavic nationalists supporting their expulsion from the mountains.  Either way, they’ve lived in the mountains for hundreds of years - they doubt anybody will be able to take their homes from them."

# SCANDINAVIA #

danish_desc: "With a proud history to back it up and a disdain for anything German, Danish nationalism developed during the slow unification of Germany and the threat the concept posed to Denmark's possession of Schleswig-Holstein and, in some sense, the Danish culture at large. German authors posing the question of \"what is Germany?\", like the Brothers Grimm, often considered Danes under the same umbrella as the Dutch and Prussians: part of a larger Germanic sphere. Through this pressure, Danish identity grew out of the new middle class, promoting the Danish language and the uniquely Nordic roots of Denmark opposed to Germany at large.\n\nAs Denmark remains a notable nation in Europe, Danish nationalism and its sense of community are still fixated to the Danish place in global affairs. Often a mediator for the global powers and keeping a tight fist on the Baltic Sea, Danish identity does not shun larger ambitions and has emerged as a blend of rural fairy tales and traditions and an urban sense of enlightenment, humanism and liberalism."
swedish_desc: "Sweden's industrialisation has been a slow process, transforming a predominantly rural country to the industrial power it now is in less than 30 years. Yet, the Swedish people did not forget their roots and the countryside remains a powerful source of traditional pride and identity. In a similar vain to Germany's romanticism tied to the Völkische movement, nature and recreation in nature are big parts of Swedish identity, with skiing being the sport that represents Sweden's virtue and heroism best. Combined with the traditional conscription of Swedes into the army and the establishment of local skiing communities, post-industrialised Sweden finally found one unifying identity.\n\nBeyond nature, Sweden is bound to its religion, language and history of folklore. Religiously, Sweden and its monarchy are defined by the Lutheran church, which came to dominate Scandinavia proper and separate it from its more catholic German neighbours. Yet, Germanic influence is still felt in both the language and folklore of the old Nords. Old folklore has been adopted into the same concept of Swedish identity as nature, hearkening back on Sweden's natural and Nordic history while preserving the local differences."
sami_desc: "Called Lapplanders by both Swedes, Norwegians, Fins and Russians, the Sámi people prefer the name they have given themselves over the name pushed upon them by the occupiers of their ancestral lands. Part of the Finno-Ugric family of cultures, the Sámi retain many traits of their ancestors, living nomadic lives, herding reindeer and living in small local communities in the icy north of Scandinavia. While most practice their particular version of shamanism, many Sámi people were forced to adopt Lutheranism and eastern Orthodoxy by the Swedes and Russians.\n\nStill, the Sámi are forced to not speak their languages at schools, in public and at work, as Swedification policies keep the \"uncivilised language and norms\" of the Sámi out of public life, while Russian policies have been extremely oppressive to Sámi culture in general, killing reindeer and promoting Russian speakers to move to the cold region of the Sámi people. It remains to be seen if the ever decreasing Sámi populations can keep themselves from disappearing completely, as more of the younger generation is brought up separately from old Sámi traditions."
norwegian_desc: "A Norwegian identity, despite the efforts of a more unified Scandinavian identity by Copenhagen, was incidentally the result of the union between Norway and Denmark. Norway, becoming and treated as a rural backwater by the Copenhagen government, saw its identity birthed from its agrarian culture being threatened by Danish urbanism. With the help of many Norwegian intellectuals, local culture became immortalised in paintings, poetry, museums and more, bringing a national reawakening to the Norwegian people and highlighting their differences with the Copenhagen-centric worldview of the Danish.\n\nNational characters like the Ashlad and traditional clothing defined what it meant to be Norwegian, even in its Danophile cities like Oslo. Rural traditions and tales got popularised in the entire region through books and a continued effort by academics to push for more Norwegian self-awareness. With the Danish government growing unpopular and more Norwegian people rethinking their identity, a national community of Norwegians may be on its way to independence in the coming decade."
finnish_desc: "Departing from the Swedes in the early modern age, Finland started its national awakening under the Russian boot. Swedish as a lingua franca among Finnish intellectuals and bureaucrats disappeared with the Russian emphasis on Finland's unique culture, then thought to be a good way to separate the Finnish people from the Swedes and absorb them into a larger, multicultural Russian empire. Yet, instead, Finland gained an identity separate from Moscow's ambitions and instead started Finland's own project of nation-building. Like many parts of Europe, schools, gyms and hobby clubs became central to an emerging nationalist middle class.\n\nSince then, Finnish identity has come under threat of a more Slavic-centric Russian government. Russian immigrants to Finland are consistently shunned by the present Finnish middle class, yet Russian has slowly turned into another lingua franca for the upper class, with the elite schools teaching in Russian. The middle class, however, remains a bastion of Finnish identity, trying to break free from the Tsar's tight grip on Finland's people."
karelian_desc: "A Baltic-Finnic people that call the forested lands of Russian Karelia their homes, the Karelian people are a community closely intertwined with the Finnish people, hailing from similar historic roots and talking in a similar tongue, though with a notable dialect. Despite their closeness to Finland, the Karelians are distinct from the Fins in their eastern orthodox faith, mixing the teachings of the Russian church with local folklore and shamanism.\n\nSharing similar literature, music, tales and arts with the Finnish people, even describing the same epic poetry \"Kalevala\" as their national epics, the Karelian people remain closely intertwined with the Finnish people and thus, due to Russian occupation, have suffered under similar repression. Yet, a Renaissance of Finno-Karelian identity has emerged from the Great War and the resistance of the Finnish in Russian territory, in which Karelianism and the Karelian people play an important role as archaic Fins who, untouched by Swedish and Russian influence, are the closest people to the authentic Finland of old."

Southern-Italian food, such as the famous pizza and many types of pasta, are popular not only in Naples but all over the world as well.  Beyond food, Southern-Italians are known for their adherence to Catholicism, their folk music, and organized crime via the Italian Mafia which operates heavily in southern Italy.  Southern-Italians value family and community above all - which is where their love for food and music comes from.  Anything that can bring the family - or town - together is valued by Southern-Italians.

Although not much remains of the Sardinian language, it is still spoken by the older population and is still taught in smaller circles. Sardinia although a very formal part of Italy, has some autonomy which allows the island to keep its traditions and culture.

spanish_desc: "The Spanish have been everywhere, from the Americas to the Philippines, and as such their culture is very well one of the most famous.  The food, the art, the music, the traditions - all of which are associated with one of Europe’s most interesting and international cultures in the world.  One cannot associate Spain without thinking of its many fames, such as paella and classical guitar.  One of its most important aspects, Catholicism, has become so important that it has an actual place in Spain’s government.  In a wave of theocracy and neo-imperialism, most of Iberia, the Spanish included, embraced the place of their God in everyday government.  Religion has played larger and larger roles with the outbreak of Carlism in the nineteenth century to the modern day, and while other groups amongst the Spanish resist, it seems they’re the main force behind the ultimate Christianization of Iberia."
portuguese_desc: "The Portuguese are a people of adventure and trade.  As once the owners of one of Europe’s largest colonial empires, and having influence all over the globe until recently in modern history, much of what the Portuguese discovered about the world around them has not been forgotten.  Their influence was so wide-reaching that the Lusophone world lives from Brazil to southern Africa, where Portuguese speakers reside.  Political instability has made its way to the Portuguese, with a failed monarchy giving way to Portugal’s modern theocracy based on its long-standing religious nature, much like their Spanish brethren to the east.  Whether this regime will last - and if the Portuguese people truly desire theocracy - still stands to be questioned, but it seems finally the Portuguese have found their political niche."
galician_desc: "Some consider the Galicians a Romance people while others consider them Celtic - either way, the Galicians are a proud people with centuries of rich history.  As they had one of the original crusader states in northern Iberia, Galicians went on to found Portugal and resisted control from Castile until they imposed a Santa Hermandad occupation on the region.  Since then, Galicia has been stuck in-between two claimants, the Spanish and the Portuguese, in which the region has changed hands multiple times over the course of centuries.  The Galician culture is rich in art, song, and traditions, especially with the Celtic revival that occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, and tend not to follow nationalist or neo-imperialist ideals as closely as other groups in Iberia do."
catalan_desc: "For a thousand years, the Catalan people have been one of Iberia’s most important groups of people.  Participating in the Reconquista and founding their own empire - Aragon - in the early centuries of the second millennium, the Catalans enjoyed their place at Iberia’s table of important nations.  All of that changed after the Union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, and the Catalans have been sidelined by the Spanish ever since.  As such, this is translated into frequent rebellions against the Spanish - some in nationalist nature, some political - and Catalonia has seen much strife, especially with the advent of nationalism in the early nineteenth century and neo-imperialism in the early twentieth.  They continue to fight to this day for independence, though their uprisings are piecemeal."
basque_desc: "The Basque people are truly unique, with a language and customs that can’t be traced to any ancestor.  They’ve inhabited the Basque Country, a territory from northern Iberia to southwestern France, for millennia, and are historically one of Iberia’s most religious regions.  They share a history of militant nationalism and religiousness, fighting wars of independence and regime change against Spain for centuries.  They famously joined the Second Carlist War because of the loss of their special autonomous privileges and to establish a traditionalist, almost theocratic monarchy in Spain.  In a twist of fate, they have escaped the Spanish theocracy and formed their own Basque state - but with a traditionalist Spanish to their south and an expansionist France to their north, they’re in-between a rock and a hard place."

andalusian_desc: "Andalusian culture, despite its minority within the Iberian peninsula, has largely created much of Spain’s modern cultural hallmarks - from flamenco to bullfighting, and even the musical chord progression named after them, the Andalusian cadence -  the Andalusian people have been incredibly influential to not only Iberian culture but the world’s perception of it.  Modern Andalusian culture developed after the Reconquista and has since dominated southern Spain from Huelva to Cartagena.  Unlike the Catalans or Basques to the north, Andalusian nationalism isn’t nearly as popular, and as such many consider Andalusia to be a core part of Spain.  However, there are still some calls for autonomy for Andalusia - but any notion of independence is usually only shared by staunch nationalists."

# BALKANS #

hellenic_desc: "Hailing from the times of Homer and Alexander the Great, the Hellenic people are occupants of this grand hall to humanity's monuments known as the Greek peninsula. From the wonders of democracy to the magic of mathematics, the Greeks brought much to the modern world, upon which the rest of Europe was build on. After our achievements of greatness during the Hellenistic era, the Romans came and gave us another shot at might, birthing Byzantium out of the corpse of Rome. Byzantium rose and Byzantium fell, turning the great inventors and philosophers into subjects of the Turkish sultan.\n\nSince our independence, Greek identity has been defined by a similar struggle of national self-governance as the rest of the Balkans. Greeks deserve a Greek government, yet many Hellenes are still outside of Greece's borders, subject to oppressors not unlike the sultan. Baked into the same ethno-linguistic roots as most other European identities, Greek identity is about championing the return of all Greeks under a Greek government. From Epirus to Thrace and Cyprus to Anatolia, it is all Greek to us."
albanian_desc: "The mountains of this land house a peculiar people, formed into a unique community, unlike any other culture in the Balkan. Defined by their code of honour, their religious tolerance and their struggle for independence, the Albanian people remain a product of history, both its independent past as its occupied past. No symbol symbolises this better than the black, double-headed eagle on the Albanian flag, the embodiment of Albania's valour and independence.\n\nAlbanian culture is divided along north-south lines linguistically, with the north housing the Gheg, while the south is dominated by the Tosk. Despite centralisation efforts under the kingdom, no single dialect has been chosen as a standardised version of Albanian. Through its languages and oral tradition, Albanians preserved a unique system of honour, known as Kanun. Central to Kanun is Besa (to keep one's word) and Nderi (honour). Language, independence and a culture of honour is perhaps the shortest summary of what unifies this peculiar people of the Western Balkan."
slovenian_desc: "Slovenian identity, like many notions of nations, came to the region in the form of the protestant reformation, when bibles and religious texts were translated into Slovenian. From there, the enlightenment emboldened intellectuals, who saw the distinct language and folklore of the Alpine Slavic people as clearly Slovenian, more influenced by Austrian, German and Italian ideas than the Russian and Turkish influenced Croatians, Bulgarians and Serbians. Under the German government, Slovenians were able to keep a hold on their unique regional identity, forming a periphery of the German empire that showed the Slavic roots of the border region.\n\nThe rich list of Slovenian folklore and symbols reinforce its independence from both Germanic and Slavic cultures. Ranging from the mythic Goldhorn to Grohar's \"The Sower\", depicting the idyllic Slovenian countryside, Slovenian culture remains a mix of its rural and medieval traditions, tied to the regions of Carniola and Carantania, and the enlightenment's focus on linguistics and literature, leading to the adoption of a common identity, justified by loose threads of history."

Differing from the Croats of the Hinterland, who are closer to the Bosnian-Croats, the Dalmatian people are the historical product of decades of Venetian occupation, trade and culture. In the 20th century, this influence has waned, but it remains ever present in the fact that most Dalmatians still speak Italian, per chance by the limited attempts of centralisation during Croatia's short time as an independent nation.\n\nThe Italian cultural influence is also seen in Dalmatian architecture, far more distinctly Mediterranean than Slavic. Even the Croatian cuisine seems absent in many of Dalmatia's coastal cities, replaced by Italian dishes with a hint of a Slavic twist to them. Religiously, the Fetivi don't clash too much with Croatian Catholicism, practising Catholicism as well, though often following the words of the Vatican more closely than those of the Hinterland or Zagreb."

Serbs, Croatians, and Bosniaks come together in this region, sharing culture and religion.  Both Orthodox Christianity and Sunni Islam dominate Bosnian culture with clashes between the groups a common occurrence.  However, in recent years, Bosnia has become more stable, especially with Serbian rule - so now the Bosnian people fight each other less than they did a decade ago.  From the Ottomans to the Austrians, many nations have ruled the Bosnians adding their own culture to the mix of the Bosnian stew, making it truly one of the most unique cultures in all of Europe."

From the 19th century onward, Bulgarian identity would find itself victorious against the Ottoman Turks, securing independence and self-governance for the Bulgarian people.\n\nBulgarian culture exemplifies a spectacular range of Slavic oddities: from its highly complex and irregular folk music, to the extremely weird costumes worn during customs, to the mandatory salades at every meal. It is perhaps the mixing and matching of various civilizations, like the Thracians, Goths, Scythians, Romans, Celts and the Bulgars that have formed this unique culture in the corner of the Balkans."

Yet they remained different.\n\nA culture so defined by its history, remaining independent as a state for decades, stays true to its roots as a christian and Magyar nation. When looking around the countryside, folk music, stories and clothing still reflect upon our ancient age. In the great city of Budapest, memories of medieval times remain in the architecture and arts. Even when the revolution came, the people remain close to their past and a sense of pride and community highlights that most clearly."

Mainly under the thumb of the Hungarians for over centuries, Ruthenia, despite its provincial and rural geography, turned into a collective centre of an Ukrainian Renaissance in the 19th century, together with Polish Halychyna.\n\nDespite their ties to the Ukrainian lands, the Ruthenian people are still distinct from the rest of Ukraine. Following the teachings of the Eastern Catholic Church and speaking in a dialect that is hard to understand for Ukrainians and Russians, the provincial status of Ruthenians has clearly divided them from the rest of Ukraine. However, it remains to be seen if these people, having survived since the medieval ages and all of its persecution, can continue their Ukrainian Renaissance. Hungarian and Russian attempts to crack down on Eastern Catholicism and the regional dialect continue and the Ruthenian people suffer for their unique identity."

Taking influence from Russian, Greek, and Turkish cultures, Ukrainians are defined by their food, their history, their war tactics, and their defiance against enemy encroachment. Ukrainians have fought multiple wars against their Russian overlords for hundreds of years - some succeeding, some failing - and have established multiple states, many led by the well-known Ukrainian Cossacks.

polish_desc: "The Polish people have endured a long history of both leading and being subjugated by mighty empires. And despite various efforts to stamp out their culture, Polish identity remains firm within Eastern Europe. Despite this however, Poland's culture is indeed a formation of the various other cultures that surrounded it. Given the nation's location in the heart of Eastern Europe, such cultural acquisitions were inevitable and can be seen even in their architecture.\n\nDespite this, Polish culture is defined by two major traits: survival and independence. Polish culture has weakened through history, but never died. Due to efforts to stamp it out, Polish culture is defined by art and music, encouraging these pursuits be done to save their identity. And what is produced, emphasises Poland over anyone else and a desire to be free from those who would destroy them with an almost nationalistic fervour. This has lead some foreign observers to question if a cultural crisis is inbound. Poland has defined itself by a desire for freedom for so long, it is a huge part of their culture.

Poles here speak Polish with a Russian-influenced dialect and write Polish in a special cyrillic alphabet.

From the very beginning they are known for assimilating peoples and conquering them. Initially present only in the east of Europe in the form of various principalities which in time were united by the Principality of Moscow, after defeating the Mongol peoples in Europe their hunger for expansion only increased.\n\nSubsequently transformed into a Tsardom as the centuries passed, they spread over more and more territories including much of Asia while rapidly colonizing Siberia, the Caucasus and the Central Steppes. Without hesitation they conquered more and more lands, even at the cost of the local population and then, in the case of any uprisings, they brutally suppressed them, while the incoming masses of Russians and the ever-increasing Russification effectively devastated other nations and cultures. In recent years, through various crises, despite their efforts, they were forced to create autonomous states on their western borders.

At the same time, they consider multiculturalism to be something ridiculous and contrary to the patriotic narrative according to which only true Russians faithful to the ideals instilled in them throughout the country's existence have the right to live in Mother Russia. Support for this idea is most evident in the largest urban centers where ethnic Russians form a nearly exclusive population."
siberian_desc: "Siberians are the descendants of the oldest people from the early colonization of Siberia who developed a separate culture by their location. Russians arriving in the area from later periods call them \"Starozhily\" which means \"old settlers.\" They live mainly in the northern or easternmost part of Russia. They live simple lives just as they did at the beginning of colonization, consisting of survival in inhumane conditions and thus are often employed in industry in these territories precisely because of their endurance and knowledge of local survival arts. They played an important role during military operations in Siberia"
finno_ugrian_desc: "Living in the northeastern European part of Russia, the Komi people are natives of these lands especially in the Kama River basin. Many of them continue to be hunters or fishermen. They are proud of their distinctiveness despite attempts to assimilate them and fairly recent Christianization. Despite their separate identity, their specific writing has been replaced by Cyrillic and their folklore and shamanism superseded."
yakutian_desc: "The Yakuts are a Turkic ethnic group native to northern Siberia. With the arrival of the Russians, their peace was disrupted, the first by the introduction of the pelt tax, which led to a brutally suppressed rebellion and terror for the local population. Over the following years, further uprisings were suppressed and the Yakut population dropped by more than two-thirds through diseases and failed uprisings. In the 19th century, Russia eased its grip on the area thus, in later years most of the population was converted to Russian Orthodox church. They are known for traditional focusing of rearing horses, reindeers and raising Yakutian cattle."
volga_german_desc: "Volga Germans are the descendants of German settlers who made their homes mainly on the east bank of the Volga River near Saratov, some 1,500 miles from Germany. They’ve made their home in majority-Russian territory beginning in 1762 when Catherine the Great invited European settlers to the Volga.  Many of these settlers were German.  Many had special rights within the country including the right to avoid military service due to the Volga Germans’ pacifism resulting from the prominent Mennonite Church - but as this right was revoked in the 19th century, a large majority of Volga Germans moved to the Americas.  However, even with this loss of population, the Volga German community near Saratov continues on to this day with a rare status as a protected group in Russia."
avarian_desc: "The Avars are actually 15 related ethnic groups living in villages in the Caucasus 2,000 meters above sea level.  Though they used to practice Eastern Orthodoxy, they now practice Sunni Islam after the formation of the Avar Khanate.  They’ve survived invasions from the Mongols and Persians, and now they live under the Russians, where they’ve suffered from injustices including heavy taxes, expropriation of estates, and the construction of forts in their homeland.  They revolted at one point, forming the Imamate of Dagestan, but this rebellion failed and led to many Avars moving to Turkey.  The word “Avar” translated to “mountaineer,” and the Avars are considered to have a highlander culture, and they also consider themselves an armed people in their mountains."
kalmykian_desc: "The Kalmyks are a Mongolian group of people living in the northeastern Caucasus of Russia.  They are the only Mongolian group living in Europe and the only Buddhist culture on the continent.  They are considered a remnant group of the Mongol Empire, descended from Oirat Mongols that once lived all over Central Asia and Russia.  They once had their own khanate, but are now a subject of Russia - but unlike their European subjects, they’ve been left to tend to their fields and livestock, living peaceful nomadic lifestyles among few rebellions.  They represent old Mongol history in Europe; nomads making a living along the Volga and the Don."
kubanian_desc: "The Kuban Cossacks or also called Kubanians recognize the year of the formation of their culture in 1696 when the Azov Campaigns took place. Their modern history begins with the settlement of the Cossacks in the Kuban region and the colonization of so-called New Russia, north of the Caucasus. They have a rich military history, strongly linked to service under Moscow's orders, including skirmishes with the local population or wars with other countries. With Russia's increasingly aggressive policies regarding nations under its rule, they have lost ground."
circassian_desc: "The Circassians are a people of the Caucasus - however, their main populations are in Anatolia.  This is due to the Circassian genocide, an ethnic cleansing campaign conducted by the Russian Empire in which 80-97% of all Circassians in Russia were killed or expelled from their homeland.  However, not even genocide could keep these people down; they thrive in the Ottoman Empire and their population rises again in Russia and - as an unintended consequence - their culture has spread Circassian culture as far as Western Europe and the Middle East due to the resulting Circassian diaspora.Their culture is famous for its Muslim faith, early attempts at local democracy, traditional dances, and carpets, all of which contribute to its rich, resilient, and colorful society."
latvian_desc: "Latvians are one of the last living people belonging to the Balts group. Their lives and traditions were marred by the Teutonic Order which bloodily \"converted\" them to Christianity. For most of their history they were under the rule of Poland, Sweden or Russia. Despite several centuries under a foreign boot that trampled the Latvians, these people never surrendered their pride in their identity.\n\nTheir national consciousness was born in the 18th century when they had to live in the shadow of the Baltic Germans who considered themselves a superior race. Despite further attempts to assimilate them, this time under the yoke of Russia, these continued to bravely resist the occupants."
estonian_desc: "Estonians are Baltic Finns who originally referred to themselves as \"maarahvas\" or \"country folks.\" Estonia was for centuries ruled by the Scandinavian states which had a great influence on their perception of themselves as Nordic.\n\nThese people were relatively late in developing a sense of nationality as Estonian, certainly a major influence of the increasing promotion of literature in their mother tongue. Their further history took place as part of Russia, where, based on the nationality movements of adjacent oppressed nations, they created their own. Despite their differences in culture, they share a special bond with their Baltic neighbors."
russobaltic_desc: "The Russian colonization of the Baltics has always been a slow and arduous process, until now. The Baltics have, in the last ten or so years, experienced genocide, deportation, and assimilation. In their place new Russian families happily fill these empty homes, slowly, day by day, rooting out the whatever remnants of the Baltic people before them.\n\nThe Russobaltic culture really is just a term to define Russians living in the Baltic Region moreso than an actual cultural identity, many of these people would still consider themselves proud Russians."
kazakh_desc: "Living in central Asia, the Kazakhs have their origins in the formation of the Kazakh khanate in the 15th century after the breakup of the Golden Horde. They are a predominantly nomadic people known for their cuisine that includes lamb and horse meat, and their tradition and culture dictates that they should placate the visitor with food and housing. Despite the subsequent Russian colonization of their lands, thanks to their vast territory, the Kazakh people have retained a relatively high degree of freedom of being as well as traditions, and have not been Christianized out of being Sunni."

They’re an Islamic Kipchak Turkic group related to the Tatars and Kazakhs, their ethnic neighbors.  Bashkirs are an ancient group, being written about in the Chinese Book of Sui in 636 AD and recorded by Arab and Persian writers by the 9th century.  Conquered by Russia in the 16th century, the Bashkirs formed their own autonomous region, Bashkortostan, which remains fiercely independent amidst Russian nationalism and ethnic integration.  They’ve revolted four times since they were taken over, but despite each revolt failing, the Bashkirs refuse to submit to Russia."
udmurtian_desc: "The Udmurts, or Otyaks according to Russians, are a Permian-Finnic people.  They’re rich in culture; their national epic, the Dorvyzhy, their native instruments, and their semi-nomadic lifestyle in the forests define them.  The only part of their culture they’ve lost is their clan structure, but as times change, so must their government.  They’re considered an integral part of Russia, as their homeland takes up Izhevsk and land west of Perm.  They’re related to the Komi, and like them, they practice Eastern Orthodoxy, though small groups of Lutherans, Pentecostals, and Muslims practice their religions as well, along with the Udmurt Vos, or Udmurt Faith, their ethnoreligion which has been seeing a revival in modern times."

Most Nenets do not settle into communities and survive on hunting, reindeer herding, and fishing.  The Nenets have recently begun to thrive - wolves used to decimate their reindeer herds, but with the invention of the snowmat, wolf populations have been decimated and the reindeer herds prosper.  They bred the Samoyed dog, a dog breed which is now adopted all over the world.  They have not given up their shamanistic and animistic beliefs, which call for respecting the land and its resources.  The Nenets are lucky; they’ve been left alone by the Russians for most of their history."
buryatian_desc: "The Buryats are a Mongolian people living in Far East Russia.  They are quite a unique people; their relationship with nature, nomadic society, and Tengrism have made them seem mystical to European Russians who view them as an odd tribal minority.  However, the Buryats’ traditions are in fact older than Russian culture itself and can trace their history back a thousand years as descendants of the Mongol people.  Many Buryats believe they can trace their lineage back to a single legendary person which changes depending on which region you’re in.  The Buryats are quite communal; their neighbors tend to be relatives and everybody else a friend."
tatar_desc: "The Tatars are many Turkic ethnic groups, all of which call themselves \"Tatars\". They live from Crimea to Siberia, though most live in Tatarstan, located in central Russia where Volga Tatars is largest group of them all consising of over 3 million people. Tatars are known for their festivals, their art, and their cuisine, mostly based on hot soup, dough, and sweets, and their beverages mostly made from yogurt. Their traditional clothes bear bright colors and their culture is quite upbeat.\n\nTatars have resisted Russification mainly due to the fact their large population encourages their culture to live on. Tatars are famous for their integration of the automats in their farming practices, with the advent of the Tatar walker-tractor becoming a staple tool in agriculture as far away as the American West and the Australasian islands."

The Altai practice a shamanistic culture, following the Burkhanist religion and revering shaman leaders in their nomadic societies.\n\nThe Altai live simple, ancient lives, eating meals of horsemeat and mutton and wearing robes, fur hats, and sheepskin coats. They’re quite similar to Mongols despite their Turkic roots, and the name \"Oirats\" is applied to them in the context of their relationship with Mongols.

uzbek_desc: "The Uzbeks are a native people of central Asia with Turkic ancestry. Their conquest of the region was finalized in the 16th century, during which time they established a number of states, the most powerful of which was the Bukhara Khanate which fell victim to Russian colonization a few centuries later. The Uzbeks continue to make up a large percentage of the region's residents and their territorial reach extends all the way to the lands of Afghanistan where further south they make up a decreasing share of the population. Most are Sunnis of the Hanafi school. Uzbek colorful and rich architecture full of mosaics and geometric patterns adorns the cities of the great steppes."
turkmen_desc: "The semi-nomadic Turkmens are one of the oldest ethnic groups in the area, descended from the Oghuz tribes. From ancient times they were traders around the Caspian Sea, which allowed them to come into contact with Europeans. They are known for their unique patterned embroidery and weaving, as well as their cuisine that includes camel meat. The Turkmen peoples had a huge influence on the Middle East and Anatolia. Various tribes formed military alliances to resist Russian occupation but fell victim to imperialism partly through the region's rich cotton industry."
tajik_desc: "Concentrated in the Fergana Valley and the Pamir Mountains are the descendants of settlers from Iran - the Tajiks. This group got its name while the Turks began to use it to distinguish the Persian-speaking inhabitants of the region. Before they converted to Islam several centuries ago, they were Zoroastrians or Buddhists."
kyrgyz_desc: "Descended from Turkic peoples living in Siberia, the Kyrgyz now inhabit the western parts of the Tengri Tagh mountains. Over the centuries they have lived in the neighborhood of many other ethnic groups that have influenced them. Their traditional products are felt carpets and wedding Tush kyiz hung on walls. There is a small diaspora in Chinese Manchuria who were exiled there during the Qing reign."
pontic_desc: "The Pontic Greeks are a Greek people who live in Pontus, a region in Turkey on the shore of the Black Sea and in the Pontic Mountains.  Pontic Greeks are descended from Byzantine Romans, a remnant of Byzantine rule that has since been replaced by the Turks.  They still persist, however, and although they’re not as populous as they once were, they continue on as strong as ever.  Many are Greek nationalists calling for their reunification with Greece from the Ottomans, though Russian meddling prevents this from occurring.  They have a history of being persecuted by the Ottomans which has, by the 1930’s, translated into insurgency against the Turks."

In the 14th century they began to be the main Muslim center in Europe, later in the same century the seeds of Crimean separatism began to emerge. In the following centuries, the Crimean khanate was established which then became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire for almost 200 years. The main source of economy was the Black Sea slave trade of Slavic origin with Muslim countries in the Middle East.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the khanate allied itself with Russia and then became an integral part of it. Contacts with different ethnic groups over the centuries created a unique cultural mix as Crimea was a melting pot of many peoples from different parts of Europe and Asia."
tuvan_desc: "Tuvans are a traditionalist Turkic people who have raised cattle and other animals and lived in yurts for thousands of years. Many of them practiced Tengrism until in the 18th century they were converted to Tibetan Buddhism through contact with the Mongols nevertheless they retained many shamanistic elements. They perfected skiing mainly for hunting animals."
khakas_desc: "The Khakas are descended from the same peoples as the Kyrgyz. They arrived in their present lands shortly before the arrival of the Russians who quickly subjugated the Turkic people. They led a nomadic life but quickly converted to the Orthodox Church and adopted the Russian way of life. They are living on lands full of metal ores and gems"
mari_desc: "Ugro-Finns also known as Cheremis living in central Russia, their ethnic name translates literally as \"humans.\" Inhabiting the area for centuries, they have a rich history under many empires, and their culture shows Mongol, Tatar or Volga Bulgarian influences. During the Russian conquest of these lands, the Hill Mari helped the invaders while the rest resisted, which ended in heavy tolls on the population. To escape the ensuing Christianization a lot of the Mari fled to Bashkortostan. Over time, a shamanistic religion with its own pantheon, was revived among all the Mari groups and their total population is about two hundred thousand."
chuvash_desc: "The Chuvash people native to the Volga area are a Turkic people from the Oguz branch. Centuries of contact with Russians who converted them have taken their toll on the daily life of the Chuvash, a peaceful people who live a simple life. A large number have been converted but the rest are either Sunnis or believe in traditional shamanism. The last century has seen a revival of their culture, including, for example, sacrificing geese in shrines called keremet and embroidering with patterns specific to them."
mordvin_desc: "The Mordvins consist of two main people groups - Erzya and Moksha. They have a long shared history, including being subjugated under Russia in the 13th century. Like most peoples in the area, they were converted from shamanistic religions and rituals. Their clothing and also their appearance makes it easy to distinguish them from Slavic Russians. The Erzas believe that their gods hatched from an egg, while the Moksha believe that the world was created in many stages in which one of them was the spitting out of moistened building material by the devil. Despite their differences as well as similarities, the Mordvins are actively fighting for autonomy and representation on the international stage but all attempts are suppressed by Russian nationalism."
ob_ugric_desc: "Two similar but also different peoples, the Ostyaks and Voguls living beyond the Urals in the area once known as Yugra. By similarities, they are counted as one broader ethnic group whose closest cousin is the Hungarians. Both of these peoples worship animals, mainly bears, and their folklore is filled with oral epics of poetry, fairy tales, mythology and biographies. They were among the first peoples east of the Urals to fall victim to Russian-imposed religion and repression for refusing to convert to another faith. In the past they settled areas further east but were pushed out by Russian colonialism."

# SOUTH AMERICA #

amazonian_desc: "Amazonian is used as an umbrella term to group all native people of the Amazon basin. Despite wildly different cultures, religions and politics, these tribes still share a common history in their struggle against Brazilian colonisation. When Brazil still stood tall and rubber production caught up, the Amazonian people were giving an early warning what could have been, with Brazilian peasants working on large plantations, often at odds with the natives due to land conflicts.\n\nThe collapse of Brazil put a long, fortunate end to this. The natives, warned about the intents of the Brazilians, saw to reorganise themselves better. Amazonian culture underwent decades of development in the span of years, forced to as the threat of the white man's greed remained ever present."
argentine_desc: "Argentina is a nation as multi-ethnic as many of its neighbours, consisting of a distinct mix of European immigrants and the native populations. Yet, despite its similairities, Argentinean identity is unlike many other South American communities as it remains tied to the idea of Argentina as a nation of immigrants \"bajados de los barcos\" (straight off the boat). The constitution even recognises this idea of Argentina, with article 25 encouraging European immigration and separating it from undesireable non-European immigration. This has led to a cultural blend of Italian, Spanish, Germanic and British, among a few other minority cultures, which defines Argentina as a nation of European immigrants."
bolivian_desc: ""
brazilian_desc: "Brazilian is an odd concept in our current day and age. As the old Empire of Brazil fell, so did the idea of being Brazilian partially. In the north of former Brazil, a new identity sprung up with Equatorilian, while the south saw itself assimilate into a larger, Cisplatine identity. Nevertheless, Brazilian culture, defined by its unique Portuguese roots, remains.\n\nRejecting the ethnic nationalism popularised during the 19th century in favour of an identity based on loyalty to Brazil as a concept, it is no wonder that much of Brazil's population is triracial to some degree. Still, racism against Brazil's non-white population is prevelent, though not institutionalised. \"Whitening\" remains a soft policy on the local level and European racial sciences have become more popular among the white elite of Brazil after the failure of the Empire."
chilean_desc: "One word has come to symbolize the Chilean spirit: Roto. Once used as a classist insult to mock the poverty of the Chilean people, Roto has become this idea of the common Chilean man fighting for his nation, how impoverished he may be. A fighting spirit, born out of the desperate survival of the Chilean people for the right to exist.\n\nSince Chilean losses during the War of the Pacific and the military juntas that consistently succeeded eachother, Chilean culture has put an emphasis on its Hispanic and catholic roots. Practices with their roots in native cultures have become unchilean through decades of repression and popularizing of pseudosciences."
cisplatine_desc: "Emerging from the May Revolution during the war of independence, the Cisplatine people's \"League of the Free Peoples\", once a bastion against centralism, turned into a community of South Americans inspired by the revolutionary democratic ideals that tore Europe apart in the 19th century.\n\nSince then, Cisplatina has been heavily influenced through the Italian immigrants coming to the Rio de la Plata. The language, known as Cisplatina Castillian, generally sounds like Spanish with an Italian accent, unique from the native-Hispanic mix of the Andean and the more German-rooted Argentinean dialect. Beyond the language, the Italian inspiration is also seen in the cuisine, which mixes the beef-heavy Hispanic classics with staple Italian choices, such as pasta. It is perhaps this mix of Italian and Hispanic cultures that make Cisplatina the only professional football nation of the Southern hemisphere."
colombian_desc: "To be Colombian in this modern world is a synonym for being traditional. While the majority of the country remains mestizo, a mix of European and indigenous Americans, the white elite continues the tradition of the colonial criollos through dominating the political structure of the country. While it may not have been the intention of Bolivar when he created his Gran Colombia, the criollos surely didn't mind abusing the power vacuum after his death and propped themselves up.\n\nIn modern times, Colombia remains a multiracial nation of people that identify being Colombian as an allegiance to the country instead of an ethnic background tied to the country, yet inequality still reigns in these jungles. While white Colombians enjoy the wine of the land, the rest of the population toils and picks the grapes for them."
colombo_amazonian_desc: "Colozonian (shortened for Colombo-Amazonian) is a weird periphery of two cultures clashing heavily as one in the region. Native Amazonians and Colombians have had a troublesome relationship, as peasants often clash with natives over land. However, after decades of Colombian rule, Amazonian natives and Colombian peasants have started to combine into a separate mestizo group. Uniquely rural, in touch with their roots and sometimes even syncretic with their beliefs, Colozonian culture has not been respected in the European-dominated society of Gran Colombia."
ecuadorian_desc: "To define what is Ecuadorian is rather easy: namely, everything that isn't Colombian. While the idea of Ecuador as an imagined community of people started with the failed revolutions during the Wars of Independence, Ecuadorian identity still was able to be fostered during its years under Bogota rule. A periphery of the empire, Ecuador came to define itself staunchly as anti-Colombian.\n\nParts of this anti-Colombian attitude is translated into a liberal and unorthodox people. The rigid racial hierarchy of Colombia is rejected in favour of a more dynamic understanding of white, mestizo and black. Combining physical appearance with social class, geography, language and clothing, Ecuadorian understanding of race starkly contrasts with Colombia's rigid definitions. Still, despite this relaxed approach to race and a few other things, Ecuador's population remains faithful christians and at least a bit conservative."
equatorial_desc: "Born from the rich and distinct culture, dialect and history of Nordeste, Equatorilian resembles a more distinct mix of African, native American and European cultures than other parts of Brazil, partially due to its important role in Brazil's slavery history.\n\nWith the dissolution of Brazil, local pride or bairrismo, formed the basis for an identity separate from Brazilian. As Brazilian identity became more enthralled with European culture, the Nordeste preserved its unique melting pot characteristic. From Maracatu to Vatapá, Nordeste is proud to have the cultural dynamic it has today."
guyanese_desc: "Guyanese culture is defined by its history as a British colony. Once founded to be the sugarcane plantation of the Empire, Guyana's demographics changed rapidly throughout the 16th and 17th century, as African slaves were imported into Georgetown. When slavery was abolished, the people of Guyana were left as a mix of Afro-Guyanese, Amerindians, Europeans and a handful of Bengali workers.\n\nWhile Georgetown in the 19th century was a predominantly European city, the 20th century saw the rise of a black middle class in the city, defining its theatre, music and literature. Today, Guyana's culture defines itself in its stark contrasts: its history of slavery, the poverty many still endure and the struggles of Afro-Guyanese people and their place in the Empire."
mapuche_desc: "The history of the Mapuche people is one of conflict. When the Spanish came to the Americas, the traditional lifestyle of the Mapuche was interrupted through brutal conquest of the Patagonian plains. While intermingling with the Spanish and giving form to a mestizo population in Argentine, the Mapuche remained on tense footing with an independent Argentine and Chile. Eventually, concepts of Manifest Destiny led to the expelling of the Mapuche people from the Pampas and to the southern tip of Patagonia, mirroring the American maltreatment of the native Indians.\n\nToday, Mapuche society has modernised with a rapid pace. The Ethiopia of Patagonia, the Mapuche have become ready to defend their current homes from further Latin-American encroachment."
paraguayan_desc: "Paraguayan culture is defined by two main characteristics: its close connections to the Guaraní people and its constant struggle to survive as a community of people.\n\nBorn out of local rivalry between Asunción and Buenos Aires, Paraguayan history is one of consistent invasion and survival. Today, with half of the nation occupied by Bolivian forces, Paraguay remains a shining beacon, reminding its people across the border that the motherland remains to spite Chaco.\n\nDespite historical bagage, Paraguayan culture is still flowery. Embroidery and lace making decorate the traditional clothing of the people, while you can taste the locality in every Paraguayan dish. Native influences remain prevelant in literature, music and theatre."
peruvian_desc: "The rugged Andes mountains house the spirit of Peru as a nation. Divided by deep valleys and high mountains, Hispanic and native culture coexists. Perhaps more so than any other South American culture, Peruvian culture is syncretized with native cultures, creating an unique culture of European ideas with native American twists. From the literature, music, traditional clothing, dances and architecture, Peru embraces its relationship between communities, despite its dark colonial past."
quechua_desc: "Quechua is a general, catch-all term for a large group of Andean natives that speak Quechua languages. Finding its roots in the Inca Empire and its neighbours, the Quechua people are most prominent in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, countries where the number of Quechua speakers are in the millions.\n\nWhile clearly distinct from each other, the Spanish dominance in the South American states has given rise to Quechua nation-building, forming a more collective and united identity consciousness around the native speakers of Quechua and their struggle against Hispanic supremacy."

suriname_desc: "Defined throughout centuries of Dutch colonialism, Suriname consists of Indian, Indonesian, Creole, African, Amerindian, Chinese and European people, directly impacting the culture of the region. With many of the non-European and native population imported as a cheap labour force for the countless plantations of the colony to the point that they now form a majority of Surinamese people, Suriname's cultural identity is influenced by the history of slavery. Non-European literature often touches on the history and brutality of Suriname's plantations.\n\nSince the end of slavery, Suriname's non-European population still experience extreme poverty under a system of European rule. While talks of self-government are present, it remains to be seen if the proposals are picked up by the government in Amsterdam."

acadiana_french_desc: "Previously the name used for the French settlers of the Canadian maritime provinces in the 16th century, the term Acadian changed with the expulsion and subsequent ethnic cleansing of the region during British rule. Since then, the term Acadian has come to mean a Francophone inhabitant of the Greater Louisiana region, once France's most formidable colony in the New World.\n\nDespite local autonomy, the Acadian people remain repressed under Anglo supremacist laws, forbiding the use of French in government and other public spaces. Despite this official ban on the language, Acadia's cultural life remains brimming with French influence, as its music and theatre mix the newest fashions from metropolitan France with the local cultures of the mixed Creoles. Especially in its cuisine, deeply rooted in Occitan and French traditions, Acadia stubbornly refuses to bend the knee to the British."
anglois_american_desc: "The confines of the United Commonwealth were not able to prevent Anglo-Americans from venturing out to find a new home, and while many saw the Wild West as their new refuge, many from New England saw the largely unsettled Greats Lakes as their opportunity. Whether the will to do so was one last act of defiance towards the Empire, to tame a frontier, or to follow in the footsteps of industry, those who inhabit the region all have one thing in common, a disdain for the government in Quebec. A Michigan Anglois has more in common with a Connecticut Yankee, with the main difference being whether one supports the New York Royals or the Détroit Lions, than their countrymen in Marquette. This has led to the Great Lakes area being drawn closer and closer to the UCA and growing hatred towards the status quo. Calls for these areas to be turned into new commonwealths for America, a new Anglo-dominated dominion for the Empire, or greater autonomy from Quebec have been growing louder and louder. With the area dominating Quebec's economy and industry, the French might have to finally decide what they need to do to keep the Anglois on board. "

Vaqueros dominate these plains with their hardened world-views, going through life on their own and only their faith to fall back upon.\n\nNortemexicano is also defined by the same stark racial differences as in Southern Mexico, with the big ranches owned by an elite of purely European Mexicans, while the vaqueros are disproportionally men of mestizo origin. Only in a few places, such as California or Santa Fe, are the ranches also owned by mestizo and even native people."
old_dixie_desc: "Below the Mason-Dixon line lays the old South, once the beating heart of the Thirteen colonies when cotton made America into what it was. Remaining somewhat loyal to the Brits, Dixie would turn into a limited centre of power for the Commonwealth directly after the Revolution. Yet, good things rarely last and the abolishment of slavery, together with the industrial revolution rocking New England, led to the gradual decline into poverty of the Deep South. The big plantation houses are stark reminders of the past, monuments to the old landed elite of Dixie, who have lost any semblance of a colonial elite.\n\nDespite its losses, Dixie preserves its unique culture from the rest of the United States through the protection of its local cuisine, its rich selection of writers and the promotion of country and gospel music. Through the lense of the rest of America, Dixie is a land of many traits, both its \"souther hospitality\" and its more controversial racial notions. Especially the last trait has become problematic in recent years, as the Commonwealth government and its British allies make more and more steps towards liberalisation and equality. Few in Dixie don't share the anxiety that their Southern way of life may soon be under attack, though few would prefer to make clear which part of that life they mean."
quebecois_desc: "The Quebecois find their history in the old French colony of Quebec, hence their name. They are a people well acustomed to their climate and have a strong sense of patriotism to their nation. Despite their French origin they hold positive relations with Westminster and are in some regards considered to be a important power within the British Empire, after America that is. Despite a small vocal anglo minority the nation is largely centralized and has a strong democratic foundation."
seminole_desc: "The story of the Seminole is one present among a few tribes on the Americas, making it rather powerful in the grand history of the continent. When the Europeans came, the Seminole people were decimated by European sickness, yet persevered and build up a strong community of people thriving on Floridian farmlands. When the Anglo settlers came, the Seminole, backed by African slaves who had made Florida their home, turned the tide and made peace with the Commonwealth, turning Florida into the only native-majority state of the entire Commonwealth.\n\nDespite the political odds stacked against the Seminole people, its culture remains intact. Important events like the Green Corn Dance are celebrated state-wide, while tobacco has been granted a special religious status, exempting it from federal law and taxes. Through hardship and Goliath-like odds, the Seminole have been able to survive."
tejano_american_desc: "Texan or Tejano American describes the community of English speaking settlers in the Republic of Tejas, sons and daughters of previous American pioneers who now dominate the plains of Eastern Tejas. Rooted deeply in their freedom-loving and god-fearing culture, the Texans have been a vocal minority in the Tejas Republic, often heavily clashing with the big Hispanic landowners of the West.\n\nWith a culture heavily rooted in the old pioneers and a fascination with the tales of American heroes braving the uncivilized regions of this continent, the Texans are as \"folk\" as you can get in Tejas. Through their unique gun culture, prosperous ranches and semi-isolation from San Antonio, the Texans have been able to preserve their autonomy for quite some time at this point. Through their autonomy, these white protestants have basically formed a nation within our nation, one characterized by a \"free-and-fighting\" spirit and a rooted hatred for anything Mexican or catholic."

trekker_desc: "Descendants of generations of Anglo-Americans that packed up their bags and sought a new life in the wild bushes of America, the Trekkers have formed a culture of their own, unique from the English influence prevelant in the Commonwealth states. Defined by the Wild West, the Trekkers are generaly protestants, their roots coming from English, German and French Americans displaced by the Commonwealth regime. With a healthy distaste for authority and tied to the lands, the Trekkers consider themselves truely \"free\".\n\nUnlike the Texan and Mississippi settlers, Trekkers are more so defined by their contact with the native American and Mexican people, often clashing over the fertile grounds of the Great Plains and Pacific Coast. These agricultural problems have formed Trekkers into strong communities defined by faith and family, almost to the point of a clan system, where gun and cowboy culture that came from Northern Mexico got adapted to protestant ideas and values."

mormon_desc: "The Mormons, once beginning as a fringe, American-oriented and separate branch of Christianity, has turned into a close-knit and unique community, proud of the faith that was given form by Joseph Smith. While the community struggled to get going in the catholic north of the UC, after the trek across the Rocky Mountains, Zion was able to be build. Away from civilization, the Mormons build their theocracy upon a new culture centred around Mormonism.\n\nMormon culture is based upon the values espoused by their Church. Standards taught by Jesus, like honesty, integrity and sexual moderation are central to Mormon culture, forming a rather conservative community. Despite the hardships of the Wild West and political realities, the Mormon community remains relatively united in its faith and subserviance to the Church."

These states typically house a majority European descendant population of which can trace back their roots to Britain, Italy, France, Germany, and the United Commonwealth, however other smaller European minorities do exist in these states. There is no real unified culture to speak of for Afro-Europeans nor any shared history. The only similarity between these peoples is the language they speak, that being English. British colonial policy mandates the English language to be spoken in public areas, and unofficially in private.\n\nThe condition of African natives is unpleasant, their ancestral lands have succumbed to westernization and the ever looming threat of complete European hegemony over Africa seems to creep closer day by day.

australian_desc: "The Australian colony of New Georgia was quickly established after the failed American Revolution. Although America lost her chance at independence, she was able to negotiate, to some degree, her position in the British Empire. One condition the United Commonwealth put down was the rejection of all incoming prisoners from the British Isles. Prisons in Britain were quickly filling up and with the need for new lands to dump these so-called criminals efforts were hastily made to colonize the East Coast of the Australian continent. Meanwhile the Dutch had already largely secured the western parts of Australia rich in minerals and gold.\n\nThe Australian identity is one of mateship and courage. During the Great War a single Australian regiment held the French for three weeks during the siege of Brest, Anglo-American forces had melted under French artillery but the two thousand or so Australian soldiers held the city defiantly till the end. This momentous event has been referred to as “The Battle of Bloody Brest” and is often cited as the birthplace of the Australian identity. "
australien_desc: "The discovery of the Eastern and Southern Australian coast by French navigator Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux led to the establishment of the first French-Australian colony in the present day Australie capital of Dutigalle. Over the years the colony of Nouvelle-Occitanie begun to foster a rich Australien culture based around trade and maritime, with a more accepting attitude towards their Anglo neigbours in comparison to their origin country of France. However, as a result of the Treaty of Tours Australiens have in some aspects bore the worst of the treaties stipulations, leaving the population just as sour as their French compatriots. More than half of the Pre-War Australien population lives under British-German subject governments and the Australien economy is essentially subservient to Germany. There is still hope though, some Australiens have retained their more accepting ideals and are willing to negotiate their way out of the mess they find themselves in, but such people seem rare to come by in this day and age."

new_hollander_desc: "The Dutch were the first to both explore and colonise Australia. The story goes that a merchant vessel of the Dutch East Indies crash landed on the West Coast of Australia due to weather storms. Most of the crew had died but a few souls managed to survive for weeks amongst the arid terrain of the land. Eventually these shipwrecked sailors would manage to build a raft and sail their way back to the Dutch East Indies where they told stories and legends of lands bountiful with gold. How much of this tale is true no one really knows, given enough time eventually the Dutch royal family would sponsor the creation of a colony on this mysterious land they call New-Holland. The nation of New Holland now is one of immense wealth and prosperity, with a GDP rivalling even that of some Major Powers.\n\nNew Hollanders are a people well accustomed to the lands they call home, they may be arid and devoid of all life, but they seemingly make it their little paradise. This reality is possible in large part because of the nation's sheer amount of wealth. However, the New-Hollander people are also responsible for their nation’s success as much as the nation's vast number of resources are. They are a well-educated and fiercely democratic people and enjoy what is often referred to as the world’s best democratic institutions. If there is ever a critic of democracy all one would have to do is point at New Holland to prove the success of a democratic system done right."

But in the State of Klemzig and Port-Phillipe there has been a significant German presence, so much so, especially in Klemzig, that the Australisch population is by far the greatest in numbers alone. But these states often mimic the precarious sitatuion in Jerusalem, Australien's and Australisch Germans often but heads with one another leading to the occasional protest or riot.\n\nThe Australisch-German culture hasn't had enough time to diverisfy itself from their mainland German roots, many of which would still call themselves proud Germans, with the bulk of these Germans being Saxons, Bavarians, and West-Prussians."

japanese_desc: "Although being moderately influenced by various other cultures, like Chinese and others, Japanese people are very isolated, mainly because their nation is an island, but also because of the shogun imposed national isolation which lasted a few centuries and meant that the country was lacking not only technologically but also culturally and politically. Because of this Japanese society took a massive turn, and went from a more traditional feudal system, to a western style nation. And with the nation changing, so did the people, it became a noble duty of every man to serve for the emperor and his nation in any conflict. But despite this rapid modernization, Japanese culture is still firmly traditionalistic, with family traditions and honour being of importance to Japanese people. This allowed a distinct culture and heritage to develop for the beautiful Land of the Rising Sun."
ainu_desc: "The Ainu Yukar (Legendary sagas passed down through oral tradition) assert that the Ainu people have inhabited Hokkaido for a hundred thousand years before the arrival of the Japanese. Genealogical evidence claims this number is closer to two thousand, but the distinct heritage of Hokkaido's first people has yet to wane over those two long millennia.\n\nStanding as the largest argument against the notion of Japanese monoculturalism, the Ainu people enjoy a separate language with many dialects sprinkled across Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, and South Sakhalin aswell as a distinct animist religion; the Ainu people even have a completely separate set of day-to-day cultural practices from the mainland Japanese.\n\nIt would seem, however, that the Ainu people are destined to be ruled from Tokyo. Regarded broadly as barbarians and primitives by the people who annexed them, the Ainu people were relegated mostly to the role of laborers during the Meiji Restoration. The Japanese government seems intent on denying them the status of a separate people; having granted them Japanese citizenship upon annexation and afterwards subjecting them to fourty years of assimilation. The 1916 census places the amount of \"pure-blooded\" Ainu people around thirteen thousand, by the turn of the next century that number could be down to a few hundred.\n\nThough, as their numbers dwindle and their homeland is increasingly brought into the Japanese cultural sphere, there still lies a group determined to maintaining the practices of their ancestors."

cambodian_desc: "Being of Buddhist and Hindu nature the people have been unified in their religion from the very beginning. Ever since the days of the Khmer Empire the country has been a regional power with a strong monarch and national identity, separating themselves from the neighbouring Vietnamese, Siamese and Laos people in most cultural ways. The people often celebrate Buddhist, Hindu and cultural holidays, though even in this they stand different from their relatives in the region. They are said to be less strict in religious policy, and more liberal thinking on the political spectrum, certainly setting themselves apart from the high restrictiveness of the Siamese. Death is not viewed with the great outpouring of grief common to Western society; it is viewed as the end of one life and as the beginning of another life that one hopes will be better. Buddhist Khmer usually are cremated, and their ashes are deposited in a stupa in the temple compound. Khmer culture is very hierarchical. The greater a person's age, the greater the level of respect that must be granted to them. Cambodians are addressed with a hierarchical title corresponding to their seniority before the name. When a married couple becomes too old to support themselves, they may invite the youngest child's family to move in and to take over running the household. At this stage in their lives, they enjoy a position of high status."

malay_desc: "Malaysia is a multicultural society. The main ethnic groups are the native Malays as well as large populations of Chinese, and Indians. When visiting the country it is clear that the ethnicities retain their religions, customs and way of life. Thus migration has had a huge effect on the cultural buildup of Malaysia, this is mostly due to the economic position of Malaysia, because of it lots of immigrants come there for work, either in the countryside or in a colonial city, like Singapore. Despite multiculturalism, the native Malaysians have certainly been able to hang on to their culture and their lands. Architecture, arts, music and literature still have a distinct Malaysian feel to them. The lands of Malaysia are also quite diverse, from simple grasslands to vast jungles where many animals like the Tapir roam freely. "

papuan_desc: "The culture of Papua New Guinea is many-sided and complex. It is estimated that more than 7000 different cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea, and most groups have their own language. Because of this there is no real central Papuan culture, but rather a large number of different ones which are collectively labelled as Papuan culture. Apart from the cities, most native Papuans live in small villages inland and in the style of hunter gatherers. Despite that, the people do partake in several modern activities such as: music making, wood carving, currency, wedding standards, literature and more. And is thus becoming more and more connected with the outside world, especially since the European colonisation of the region."
hawaiian_desc: "Despite its small size, and extensive loss of population due to disease in the 1700s, Hawaii is a nation rich in culture. Indeed, some may argue that this brush with extinction has encouraged the Hawaiian population to preserve their culture as much as they can. Originating from the first Polynesian explorers who settled on Hawaii, many parts of the nation's culture are centred around water and the sea. One of their most famous cultural past times being the usage of 'Outrigger Canoes', despite the invention of far more effective modes of transport throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, this type of canoe remains prominent across the islands. Even within their deities water can be found, of their four major deities two of them are connected to water. Kanaloa is the God of the ocean and Lono is the God of rain as well as fertility and peace. While Kāne is the God of Creation and Ku is the god of war and male pursuits. In this age of Imperialism, Hawaii's culture exists as one that has managed to form independent of European colonialism until its much more recent history.  And with his status as a British Protectorate secure, the Hawaiian people will do their best to keep their culture not just alive but thriving."

euro_asiatic_desc: "An umbrella term for several subcultures, Euro-Asiatic cultures are a relatively new phenomenon. Though contact between Europe and Asia goes as far back as the Roman Empire and Han China, cultural mixing only truly took off during the years of European colonisation of Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries. During these years, many European powers established more permanent colonies. Many of these new colonists would end up mingling with local populations and even marrying into some of the more wealthy native families. As the centuries went on, this mixing of cultures formed an entirely new cultural identity. The exact nature of this culture varies greatly depending on where they are, and who lives there but the most common involve the mixing of British culture with Malaysia or German with Filipino. They are a common sight in Imperial colonies, but enclaves do exists within Eastern nations. The only truly unifying feature of this culture is the blend between identities, taking on aspects of both groups and identifying with each equally. However, this form of multiculturalism, though celebrated by some as a break down of the barrier between coloniser and colonised, is not universally approved. Many in the Imperial home territories, see it as a bastardisation of their culture. While Nationalist circles within Asia believe it is an effort to force them to Assimilate into European society. Despite these threats, Euro-Asiatic groups continue to thrive within the cultural boiling pots of Asia."
