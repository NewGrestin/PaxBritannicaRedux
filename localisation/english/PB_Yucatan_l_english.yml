  PB_YUC_Plurinational_Republic:0 "The Plurinational Constitution"
  PB_YUC_Plurinational_Republic_desc:0 "Formally known as the Plurinational State of the Yucatan, the Yucatan Republic's constitution was formalized with a significant emphasis on the rights of the native Maya people. Done less out of legitimate egalitarianism and more revolutionary pragmatism, this decision to support the Maya's rights helped garner their support during the War of Independence."
  PB_YUC_Agrarian_Army:0 "Agrarian Military"
  PB_YUC_Agrarian_Army_desc:0 "The Yucatan War of Independence was largely reliant on the mobilization of local militias drawn from the peasantry. This practice has persisted, even as the Republic's economy drives the push for reform and professionalization of the military."
  PB_YUC_Henequen_Boom:0 "The Henequen Boom"
  PB_YUC_Henequen_Boom_desc:0 "Henequen, an agave plant native to Southern Mexico and Guatemala, is one of the Republic's largest exports. Used as an ingredient in everything from fibers to tequila, Henequen farming is a booming industry in the Yucatan. Investors, spurred on by the limited regulations of the early republic, moved in to monopolize many of the plantations in the region. This is a point of contention between the Republic and the British Empire in particular, with the Imperial Fruit Company's influence over the Henequen plantations and the push for nationalization from the left causing major tension."
  PB_YUC_Revolution_Legacy:0 "Legacy of 1878"
