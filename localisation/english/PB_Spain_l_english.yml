PB_SPR_Extreme_Polarisation:0 "Extreme Political Polarisation"
PB_SPR_Extreme_Polarisation_desc:0 "Shamed by our war against the British, broken by the infamous Iberian campaign and beaten down by the loss of its colonial empire, Spain has lost any optimism in the future. The days are bleak and the people remain grim, as our prospect for prosperity grows slimmer every month. These conditions have been an unfortunate breeding ground for radicals, as the jacobins of the PPIJ and the nationalists of the FE grow with every election, winning a large share of the votes each time as people lose their patience with the established parties. The radicalisation of the population has even lead to violence, targetting anyone who stands in the way of progress or tradition, depending on what kind of radical we're talking about. Despite this climate of political polarisation, the chances of the republicans aren't completely gone and the next election in '36 could give the republicans the swift boost they need to preserve the republic for as long as time may last."
PB_SPR_Military_Conspiracy:0 "The Military Conspiracy"
PB_SPR_Military_Conspiracy_desc:0 "When the king was ousted out of Spain after the Great War, the Republic was proclaimed. The army, however, didn't change with this monumental event in Spanish history, as many of the old royal army kept their place in the republican army. While this would have already been a dangerous cocktail for any new republic to deal with, the Spanish Republic clearly outdid its republican brothers in Europe by letting the army rot, lowering expenses every single year and leaving it with ancient equipment. Thus, the army has turned against the republic. Supposedly. \n\nWhile real evidence of a conspiracy is non-existent currently, we cannot deny the possible existence of such a plan. The army has already been divided in a million different interest groups, with the monarchists and africanists being the largests of the groups. Young, ambitious men and older, experienced gentlemen have made their troops loyal to them first, putting the republic in a dangerous position. We can't last another storm if we remain ignorant of this conspiracy."
PB_SPR_War_Reps:0 "Promise of War Reparations"
PB_SPR_War_Reps_desc:0 "The defeat of the Spanish Kingdom at the hands of the British left us at the mercy of the rotten bastards in Westminster. The eventual deal wasn't as bad as he could have been, but the war reparations were an exception. The absurd amount of pesetas that we were forced to pay in the direct years after the war crippled the economy. Bad policies and corrupt politicians wouldn't improve the matter, leading to some sympathy from the UK and more leniency on the reparations. Still, these reparations remain huge sums and continue to hinder our government."
