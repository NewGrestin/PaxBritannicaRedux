 transport_helicopter_equipment:0 "Transport Buzzard"
 transport_helicopter_equipment_desc:0 "A somewhat primitive design, the Great War Buzzard, named after the comparison of its sound to  that of a colony of bees, was utilized in specific parts of the European theater during the 1910s. Seeing service in Iberia and Italy, the Buzzard was useful for supplying troops across the sea."
 transport_helicopter_equipment_1:0 "Basic Transport Buzzard"
 transport_helicopter_equipment_2:0 "Improved Transport Buzzard"
 transport_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Improving upon the Great War design, the Buzzard Mk II. is an improvement in its abilities to supply and transport troops across small distances. More nimble and swifter than its Great War grandpa, the Mk II. seems perfect  for any coming conflict."
 transport_helicopter_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Transport Buzzard"
 transport_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Being an immense step forward from the Mk II., the Buzzard Mk III utilizes two systems of rotary blade engines, creating a relatively fast and agile alternative to previous generations of transport aircraft. This \"Hooper\",  as it has been called by soldiers, is the right tool for the job."

 attack_helicopter_equipment:0 "Attack Buzzard"
 attack_helicopter_equipment_desc:0 "The Attack Buzzard is a concept that has been dreamed of since the 1920s, when the military tried  to further militarize the transportation technology it had acquired during the Great War. However, until very recently, issues of  weight and speed slowed down the possibilities. The Attack Buzzard is thus a triumph over these problems, producing a cheap  alternative to CAS."
 attack_helicopter_equipment_1:0 "Basic Attack Buzzard"
 attack_helicopter_equipment_2:0 "Improved Attack Buzzard"
 attack_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "As we continue to further our understanding of the laws of physics, our progress on the Attack Buzzard improves. Attack Buzzard II improves on the failings of the first Attack Buzzard system in immense ways, producing an attack  buzzard capable of flying further distances and isolating pockets more efficiently." 
 attack_helicopter_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Attack Buzzard"
 attack_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "A marvel on the battlefield and a dreadful sound to hear for the enemy, the Attack Buzzard III is the one of the fastest buzzards created by humanity. A strikingly good alternative to CAS due to its low costs, the Attack Buzzard III proves to be the future of warfare."

 GER_land_cruiser_equipment_1_short: "Ratte"
 GER_land_cruiser_equipment_1_desc: "The P.1000 Ratte was a German concept for a super-heavy tank developed during World War II. Proposed by Krupp in 1942, the design envisioned a 1000-ton armored behemoth armed with two 280mm naval guns, multiple secondary weapons, and armor up to 360mm thick. The Ratte was intended to serve as a mobile fortress capable of overwhelming any battlefield opposition. However, due to its immense size, high fuel consumption, and logistical impracticalities, the project was deemed unfeasible and was ultimately canceled in 1943."
