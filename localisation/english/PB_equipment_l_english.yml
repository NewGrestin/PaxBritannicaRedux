Turning the flaws of the first Automats on their head, the Mark II further stabilizes the wonky \"legs\" of the machine, allowing for greater speeds and breakthrough. While the light armor gets a slight improvement over the old Duopod design, the Mark II still sports a slender and light armor design, allowing it to be produced even cheaper than the old Duopods."
