  PBNews.1.d:0 "Britain's economic stagnation has finally come to a head. The sudden collapse of the country's investment bubble sparked a panic throughout the British economy, leading to mass panic sales and several of Britain's major Imperial Corporations going under.\n\nMillions have been left unemployed virtually overnight and the British economy is in shambles, sending shockwaves throughout the Imperial Confederation and Britain's few economic partners."

  PBNews.2.d:0 "With the death of Ali bin Hussein, Emir of the United Arab Emirates, his line of succession has been disputed. The long running rivalry between the Hashemites and Rashidis has finally erupted into open violence.

  PBNews.3.d:0 "Following extensive negotiations, the Crisis over Holland has come to a close. Despite diplomatic protests, the German delegation conceded the limited occupation of Flanders by French forces in an effort to appease French expansionism. This move proved pointless, however, and French forces simply opted to occupy the remainder of the Netherlands with minimal fighting.\n\nThe delicate concert of Europe, so carefully maintained since the end of the Great War, begins to crack under the pressures of revanchism."

The South African republics, previously kept in line by Holland, have turned on one another to finally decide the future of the cape. Two factions, the Alliantie van Democratische Krachten and the Verenigd Front, have formed between the former Dutch possessions.\n\nThe long-term effects of open civil war in Africa remain to be seen, but the conflict is likely to upend much of the old colonial order."

  PBNews.5.d:0 "The defeat of Imperial Britain has utterly decimated the British sphere of influence, and has left many of their longtime allies facing mass unrest at home. Few other nations experienced this as acutely as Egypt, and just this morning, that unrest exploded into open revolt. A series of protests in Cairo rapidly broke down when Royal Egyptian troops were ordered to open fire. Instead, they turned their weapons on their commanders and soon, on the Royal Palace itself. With the King now in custody of the military, an uneasy provisional government has been formed between the militarists, clergy and reformists."

Cornoated in a lavish ceremony in Frankfurt, the new Kaiserin has drawn some controversy from conservatives in the Empire for her open support of Stresemann's socialist government. "

This defeat and political pressure from the new Government has forced her to make the decision to abdicate as Kaiser.\n\n The new Kaiser is Franz Ferdinand, nephew of the old Kaiser Franz Joseph.He has already established his support for the new government and assurres the German People that better times are now on the Horizon."

The National People's Party, a fringe right wing party, has managed to exploit the collapse of the Tory coalition and achieve a majority in parliament.\n\nCampaigning on the restoration of traditional British values, the NPP promises grand reforms to the British people and the Empire.
