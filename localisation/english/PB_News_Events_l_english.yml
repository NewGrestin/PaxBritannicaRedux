  PBNews.1.d:0 "Britain's economic stagnation has finally come to a head. The sudden collapse of the country's investment bubble sparked a panic throughout the British economy, leading to mass panic sales and several of Britain's major Imperial Corporations going under.\n\nMillions have been left unemployed virtually overnight and the British economy is in shambles, sending shockwaves throughout the Imperial Confederation and Britain's few economic partners."

  PBNews.2.d:0 "With the death of Ali bin Hussein, Emir of the United Arab Emirates, his line of succession has been disputed. The long running rivalry between the Hashemites and Rashidis has finally erupted into open violence.

  PBNews.3.d:0 "Following extensive negotiations, the Crisis over Holland has come to a close. Despite diplomatic protests, the German delegation conceded the limited occupation of Flanders by French forces in an effort to appease French expansionism. This move proved pointless, however, and French forces simply opted to occupy the remainder of the Netherlands with minimal fighting.\n\nThe delicate concert of Europe, so carefully maintained since the end of the Great War, begins to crack under the pressures of revanchism."

  PBNews.5.d:0 "The defeat of Imperial Britain has utterly decimated the British sphere of influence, and has left many of their longtime allies facing mass unrest at home. Few other nations experienced this as acutely as Egypt, and just this morning, that unrest exploded into open revolt. A series of protests in Cairo rapidly broke down when Royal Egyptian troops were ordered to open fire. Instead, they turned their weapons on their commanders and soon, on the Royal Palace itself. With the King now in custody of the military, an uneasy provisional government has been formed between the militarists, clergy and reformists."

The National People's Party, a fringe right wing party, has managed to exploit the collapse of the Tory coalition and achieve a majority in parliament.\n\nCampaigning on the restoration of traditional British values, the NPP promises grand reforms to the British people and the Empire.

Scientists on-site have stated the object appears to be artificial in construction, resembling a large metal jar.\n\nSome have theorized that the object contains extraterrestrials, while others believe it may be a failed British or Russian orbital device. Until the object can be opened and further investigated, however, its’ origins and intent remains to be seen."
  PBNews.261.a:0 "What wonders might they bring us?"

  PBNews.262.t:0 "ALIEN MASSACRE!"
  PBNews.262.d:0 "After a few days, the anomalous object in Grover’s Mill has opened. Witnesses report tentacled alien creatures, resembling some monster mix of a brain and an octopus, emerging and regarding the crowd. Not long after, they unleashed some kind of directed energy weapon against the surrounding area, killing a great many people. The exact death toll remains undetermined, as authorities have barred any entry and begun assembling troops around the object.\n\nThe Commonwealth parliament has announced their intent to move on the object and apprehend the creatures."
  PBNews.262.a:0 "What the hell?"

  PBNews.263.t:0 "ALIENS INVADE BRITAIN"
  PBNews.263.d:0 "While the Martian menace rampages across the American Northeast, another pod crashed through the atmosphere and landed in the town of Woking, to the South of the London Sprawl. It appears the pod is identical to the one that landed in New Jersey, sparking panic across England as the alien invasion now arrives on their shores.\n\nThe British Expeditionary Force and Home Guard have mobilized to attempt to countermand the invaders, but with many of their troops tied up in North America, their ability to combat the incursion may be greatly reduced."
  PBNews.263.a:0 "They could have at least invaded Manchester first."

  PBNews.264.t:0 "ALIENS LAND IN TUNGUSKA"
  PBNews.264.d:0 "An intense explosion rocked the Siberian countryside last night as another alien pod crashed into Earth. It has been speculated that the object was originally intended for Western Russia, possibly Moscow or St. Petersburg, but this cannot be ascertained with any certainty. With the remote nature of the region, the Russian army has been slow to respond.\n\nLocals have already reported that the Martians have emerged and begun clearing the surrounding countryside, driving refugees in all directions. Many fear that the Martians may successfully take and sever the Trans-Siberian Railway, cutting Siberia off from the rest of Russia."
  PBNews.264.a:0 "I suppose they went a bit off course."
  
  PBNews.265.t:0 "MARTIAN FLU?"
  PBNews.265.d:0 "Combat correspondents have reported that Martian forces have begun to waver. It appears that some sort of illness has begun to ripple through their ranks, believed to be some form of flu or viral disease. Investigators speculate that the Martians may have been unequipped for Earthly diseases, as their civilization may have either eradicated diseases entirely or be equipped for only Martian ones.\n\nNonetheless, this is a major victory for the Earthly forces, potentially giving humanity an opportunity to push the Martians out of contested areas."
  PBNews.265.a:0 "Apparently they'd never heard of vaccines."

  PBNews.266.t:0 "LEAGUE OF EARTH FORMED"
  PBNews.266.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, diplomats assembled in the German capital of Frankfurt to proclaim the formation of the “League of Earth”. The League, lead by a coalition of the nations of Earth, plans to begin an open offensive against the Martians who have now occupied or otherwise destabilized the major powers.\n\nPreviously bitter enemies, the Habsburgs and the former Latin powers have set aside their differences to combat a new existential threat. While humanity may turn back against itself once the Martians are repelled, at least for now, we stand united."
  PBNews.266.a:0 "Let's kill those Martian bastards, together."

  PBNews.267.t:0 "MARTIANS SURRENDER"
  PBNews.267.d:0 "Facing imminent defeat, the Martian forces have approached the League with the intent to surrender. After some negotiations, Martian Invasion Command ordered their forces to stand down and surrender to the Human coalition. With their morale collapsing, many of the Martian army groups have fled into the countryside to fight on their own terms, while the rest have reported to be disarmed and processed.\n\nThe question of what to do with the orphaned invaders remains, with warhawks advocating for their extermination while others have advocated for resettling them in a quarantined district."

  PBNews.268.d:0 "Facing imminent defeat, the League of Earth has surrendered to the Martian forces. In a speech before the new Terran Congress, various diplomats and leaders announced the formal unification of Earth and Mars into a single political entity: The Terran-Martian Federation.\n\nEarth has been devastated by the invasion, with millions left homeless and millions more dead. The Martian-aligned Earth forces have already begun the process of rebuilding and repatriating surviving humans to protected cities across the planet. The first expedition of Martian colonists is expected to arrive soon."
  PBNews.268.a:0 "Two planets, united as one."

  PBNews.269.t:0 "HUMANITY SURRENDERS"
  PBNews.269.d:0 "Facing imminent defeat, the League of Earth has collapsed in the face of the Martian advance. No official surrender was signed, as no human was alive to complete the paperwork. Instead, the League’s military command has fallen, leaving the remaining human resistance disparate and disorganized. In time, it seems likely they will be exterminated as well.\n\nFurther Martian cylinders have landed across the planet, bringing with them further forces bent on eradicating any evidence of humanity. Those who have been captured live as little more than cattle to be processed for food or terraforming material."
  PBNews.269.a:0 "We had a good run, I suppose."

  PBNews.270.t:0 "MOKELE-MBEMBE KILLED"
  PBNews.270.d:0 "John Henry Patterson, notable for bagging the infamous Tsavo Man-Eaters of Kenya, presented to reporters in New Alexandria the infamous Mokele-mbembe. Originally released as part of a big game hunting event in 1922, the creature was a biologically modified animal intended to resemble a large dinosaur, largely so that those hunting could claim to have killed one.\n\nAfter escaping the hunting grounds in the German Congo, the creature became an urban legend for nearly a decade until now, where it is now expected to be stuffed and mounted for a Carnegian museum."

  PBNews.271.d:0 "The concert of Europe has been shattered by the ravaging of war. After a series of negotiations, the Berlin Administration has been completely annexed by Russia's ally the Prussian State. Originally created to handle the occupation and reconstruction of the Russian half of Germany, the Berlin Administration has been fully incorporated into Prussia. Immediately after the signing of the papers, Prussian head of state, Philipp Bouhler, has announced his plans to integrate this new territory into 'True Germany' and to purge all 'Jacobin and non-German Influence' from the country. The sheer size of territory annexed so quickly has placed a strain on the Prussian administration."

  PBNews.272.d:0 "In the first elections ever held in the Russian Empire, the Kadets have won a majority in the Duma and are expected to form a government in the coming days. Established in the midst of the Alexandrian Reforms, the Constitutional Democratic Party represents a big tent of conservative factions, kept in line by the leadership of newly minted prime minister Alexander Guchkov.\n\nWith a new electoral mandate, the Kadet government is expected to continue on a path of moderate liberalization."

  PBNews.273.d:0 "In the first elections ever held in the Russian Empire, the Zemstvoites have won a majority in the Duma. Initially established by the Alexandrian reforms, the Zemstvo began as a system of peasant councils within Russia, intended to offer some degree of political autonomy.\n\nOver time, the Zemstvo became the birthplace of the Zemstvo Party, largely representing the land-owning middle and upper class of the Russian peasantry. With a mix of conservative and liberal policy, the Zemstvoite coalition maintains a respectable majority in parliament at the present moment."

  PBNews.274.t:0 "NATIONALISTS SWEEP DUMA"
  PBNews.274.d:0 "In the first elections ever held in the Russian Empire, the National Coalition has taken a majority in the Duma. One of the most established parties in Russia, the Nationalists have been a motivating force in Imperial politics for the last decade. Finding their roots in the ennui of the postwar Russian political scene, the Nationalists advocate for a restructuring of the Russian economy and a shift towards a more diplomatically expansionist stance.\n\nWhile an unsurprising victory, the Nationalists seem likely to attempt to modify or even outright revoke the reforms that brought them to power in the first place."

  PBNews.275.t:0 "NARODNIKS IN RUSSIAN DUMA"
  PBNews.275.d:0 "In the first elections ever held in the Russian Empire, the Narodniks have surprisingly achieved a majority in parliament. An older movement in Russian politics, the Narodniks trace their origins to the late 1800s with the growth of the Russian intelligentsia.\n\nHaving broken off from their more revolutionary elements, the Narodnik government is seeking to push a number of reforms to the Russian economy and political structure, expanding the role of labour unions and the peasantry in politics."
