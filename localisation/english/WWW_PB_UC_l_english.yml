Unicom_WWW.7.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the political landscape of the 1940s has been thrust into chaos following the assassination of the United Commonwealth's Prime Minister Upton Sinclair. Preliminary investigations suggest a dark undercurrent of secret corporate espionage, with powerful business interests implicated in the plot. However, this has been mostly played off as a ridiculous conspiracy. The vacuum left by Sinclair's tragic demise has paved the way for the ascent of a more radical figure, and Sinclair's Deputy Prime Minister; Donald Grant.\n\n  Known for his anarchist leanings and outspoken views against corporate influence in politics, Grant has risen to prominence within the party. His sudden elevation to the position of Prime Minister marks a departure from the more moderate policies championed by Sinclair."
