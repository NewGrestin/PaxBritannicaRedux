An uprising.\nWe withheld our support to both sides and hoped for a quick end to the violent conflict. We expected a new approachment from London towards Ireland after the conflict, especially in the light that the Dublin Government showed their loyalty to the Confederation.\nBut the British Expansionists have used this chance to restablish complete authority over Ireland. It seems like even their closest neighbours will never be equal. How long until they come for us? "

  PB_ENG_Imperial_Tension_Category_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImperial Tension is currently at §O[?global.ENG_Empire_Tension]%§!\n\nOnce Imperial Dominance reaches 60% on either side a timer (50-100 days) will start which will continuesly increase the tension if the dominance stays within that range. Tension can also increase with events / focuses or other shit (throwing tea into the sea for example).\n\nWhen Imperial Tension reaches 90% decisions become available for America and England. These decisions become avaiable to the side that does not have Imperial Dominance (if Harmony then decisions locked and you might a chance to save it still). For America this will be 2 decisions either Indepedence or Rival England. For England its simple bring back America into the fold. As clicking on these decisions will start the Imperial civil. If the ai (the opposing side) has the option to click them, they instantly will. If you are the weak side its your own free will to click (maybe you dont want a civil war and damage the Empire beyond Repair). for the player (UK or AME their goal should be to do their Imperial Last Focuses which decide their future fates. the benefit of doing them compared to letting a Civil War happen is obvious (no war) however they take ofc longer and are most costly (u choose whats in it for you)."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.14.t:0 "British Loyalists Rise Up"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.14.d:0 "We're receiving scattered reports of unrest across New England. Several government buildings have been attacked and burned, sending secessionist supporters running. While the northernmost provinces have always been a holdout for loyalists, they were never this violent before now. British intelligence is clearly escalating the situation and activating networks of traitors who are willing to sell out the Commonwealth to London.\n\nWith the situation as unstable as it currently is, we can't spare professional troops to pacify the region in full. Local police and the RAMP will have to handle the situation as best they can."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.14.a:0 "Traitors, the whole damn lot of them."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.15.t:0 "The Bermuda Confrontation"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.15.d:0 "Escalations continue across North America, particularly in the Caribbean where the issue of Bermuda has risen to prominence again in dramatic fashion. As the British have refused to cooperate with American naval orders in Bermuda, Commonwealth Naval Command established an exclusion zone around the island. Ships identitifed as British have, until now, stopped peacefully and allowed search for military armaments. There's been some grumbling and a few spats, but nothing terribly serious.\n\nUntil now.\n\nEarly this morning, we detected a British submarine within the exclusion zone that had failed to identify itself. As per protocol, American destroyers converged on the submarine and signalled it to surface with low yield depth charges. Rather than surface, the submarine fired on one of the destroyers and sunk it before fleeing the exclusion zone. This marks the first direct attack by British naval assets on the American military, and as such our forces have abolished the exclusion zone and begun directly targeting British naval forces around Bermuda."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.15.a:0 "War is nearly upon us."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.16.t:0 "The Last Minutes Of Peace"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.16.d:0 "Flashpoints continue to spark throughout the empire. This evening, British and American forces in New England faced off and came away more confused than anything. Our report states that British troops were spotted outside Epping, an area near the rebelling New England provinces. Due to being directly marked as British soldiery, they were approached with caution. Despite this caution, a firefight ensued which left at least one dead from our side and possibly three to four on theirs, depending on who's being asked.\n\nRadio contact between British and American forces in the region has ceased entirely since then. Either the British have changed their codes or they're simply not interested in chit chat now. It's made it impossible to prevent conflict in the region, as no one is making any effort to coordinate. Shootouts are already being reported across the entire border, with both sides seemingly taking random pot shots at one another."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.16.a:0 "Who Shot First?"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.17.t:0 "The Imperial Civil War" # For AME
  ImpCiv_Crisis.17.d:0 "The time for discussion has passed.\n\nIn light of provocations from Britain, the United Commonwealth parliament voted in favor of a unilateral declaration of independence. The vote came worryingly close to a tie, echoing the first Continental Congress, but after some debate an agreement was reached. As of today, the United Commonwealth has severed all ties with the British Empire and urged her associated Commonwealths to follow suit. Whether or not they do so is ultimately up to them.\n\nNaturally, Britain has rejected this declaration and countered that America is now a rebel nation. They have stated that the declaration violated the Imperial Constitution and that America's call for independence for other parts of the Empire has violated international law. A diplomatic solution has become untenable, and the British Empire now shudders in the wake of a global Imperial Civil War."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.17.a:0 "Americans I call you to war, death to the Redcoats!"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.18.t:0 "The Imperial Civil War" # For ENG
  ImpCiv_Crisis.18.d:0 "The time for discussion has passed.\n\nThe Americans have finally exhausted our patience. The unilateral declaration of independence issued by their parliament violates the constitution of the Imperial Confederation, and that's not even speaking of their calls for rebellion to the other commonwealths.\n\nWe still have our loyalists, however, and these upstarts will be put down just like they were over a century ago. If the Americans wanted a diplomatic solution, they have indisputably made reaching one impossible."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.18.a:0 "Let us crush this rebellious nation once and for all."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.19.t:0 "Imperial Civil War Avoided" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.19.d:0 "Tensions have, strangely, simmered in the last few days. With the British government in turmoil, they've been unable to meaningfully counteract our calls for independence and the UDI. For all London's bluster, it seems the Anglo-American experiment has ended with a whimper rather than a bang.\n\nThe bizarre circumstances that allowed this have naturally created a national confusion, with loyalists and secessionists unable to reach a reasonable conclusion. America has gained her independence at Britain's expense, no doubt, but the circumstances of independence are bizarre to say the least."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.19.a:0 "Thank God."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.20.t:0 "We Are Victorious" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.20.d:0 "Today the American people and nation stand as one united whole, free from the yoke of London and her fading empire. Millions across the Coalition of Independent States rejoice as Britain has agreed to a ceasefire following months of brutal conflict that has taken the lives of many. While the specifics of the peace deal are being worked on by both sides, we can safely say that the end of war is now upon us. What the future now holds for our young nation is yet to be determined but our trial by fire is finally over. "
  ImpCiv_Crisis.20.a:0 "Land of the free, home of the brave"

  ImpCiv_War.1.t:0 "The Imperial Federation"
  ImpCiv_War.1.d:0 "With the defeat of the separatist alliance, Britain once more has triumphed over our North American inferiors. It is clear now that the decentralized model of the Imperial Confederation is simply untenable for the future. We allowed the American upstarts and their traitorous compatriots to grow far too powerful, and we paid the price for this failure in blood.\n\nThe Imperial Confederation will be abolished, and the Empire will be one once again. A single great unity of the Anglo-Saxon peoples, bound by common cause. The Imperial Parliament will become the single united parliament of the Empire, the local provincial governments unified under common law. With the stroke of a pen, the Empire is reborn."
  ImpCiv_War.1.a:0 "And this time, the sun will never be allowed to set again."

  ImpCiv_War.2.t:0 "Ireland Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.2.d:0 "Ireland, the closest former Commonwealth to the United Kingdom, has become fully integrated into the Imperial Federation."
  ImpCiv_War.2.a:0 "Very good."

  ImpCiv_War.3.t:0 "Quebec Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.3.d:0 "Quebec has been successfully integrated into the Imperial Federation. Quebec has long been a strategically important territory for both the French and the British and will continue to be a critical part of our North American territories."
  ImpCiv_War.3.a:0 "Excellent."

  ImpCiv_War.4.t:0 "Northwest Territories Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.4.d:0 "The colonial authorities of the Northwest Territory have successfully been integrated into the Imperial Federation, creating the internal provinces of Borealia."
  ImpCiv_War.4.a:0 "Excellent."

  ImpCiv_War.5.t:0 "Carnegia Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.5.d:0 "The Saharan Commonwealth of Carnegia, formerly a strong ally of the American sphere, has been successfully integrated into the Imperial Federation."
  ImpCiv_War.5.a:0 "Good to hear."

  ImpCiv_War.6.t:0 "Acadiana Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.6.d:0 "The former French territory of Acadiana has been successfully integrated into the Imperial Federation."
  ImpCiv_War.6.a:0 "Excellent."

  ImpCiv_War.7.t:0 "Victoria Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.7.d:0 "The former Commonwealth of Victoria is now being integrated into the British Imperial Federation. Negotiations have been ongoing for several months, with both sides discussing the terms of the integration. The integration is expected to be beneficial for both parties, as it will create new opportunities for trade and cultural exchange, and will help to strengthen the ties between the former Commonwealth of Victoria and the British Empire."
  ImpCiv_War.7.a:0 "Excellent."

  ImpCiv_War.8.t:0 "America Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.8.d:0 "The final component of the Imperial Federation, the United Commonwealth, has been fully integrated. With this, the Imperial Federation is now fully consolidated."
  ImpCiv_War.8.a:0 "The Empire is whole again."

  Anglois_Crisis.1.d:0 "The Midwestern Anglois Provinces are going up in flames - literally.\n\nThe Québécois Government has completetly mishandled the situation in their Angloi Provinces which are now in revolt against them. Their use of repressive force has backfired and they have lost almost complete control of the province. Angloi Militias are forming and disarming encountering army units. Quebec is unable to organize a force strong enough to restore order and calls for aid from the rest of the Confederation especially us. However the situation is now far more complicated for the usage of military power.\n\nThe United Commenwealth has sides with the Angloi protestors and proclaim that they will hinder any kind of military intervention. Tension between London and Philadelphia is growing massively. The Americans are tryin to enforce their rival power status for the first time in an extreme way.\n\nIt is well known that the United Commenwealth has been envious of the size of the Commenwealth of the Quebec and their Angloi population for decades and now it seems like they are trying to change their status quo. Philadelphias aim is to take control over the Anglois provinces once and for all.\n\nWe have to be careful. We can not abandon Quebec to the Americans as they are most loyal ally in Northern America. Leaving them weak would make the United Commenwealth the master on the other side of the pacific, a scenario which can be incredibly dangerous. However if the American get nothing of what they want the tensions between us will be explosive. The stake of the Confederation might be at stake here."

Quebec is unable to organize a force strong enough to restore order and calls for aid from the rest of the Confederation especially London. However this will not happen under our watchful eye.\n\nWe will hinder any kind of intervention, no matter what London says. The Master System from London must be challenged.\n\nThe Angloi People deserve their right to be represented by their rightful people. Too long they have been oppressed and exploited and if this continues all of their cultural ties will be extinct in the next decades. There is only one reasonable option for this crisis. The Anglois provinces must be transferred to us, preferrably all of them.\n\nHowever we have to be careful. There is a limit of how much of a challenge London and the rest of the Confederation will tolerate. London will likely not allow us to gain all of demands through this crises and stop us where they  can. However if we are unable to gain anything substantial out of this, due to London, we will not playing fair and square anymore. Our future will likely be heavily influenced by this crisis."

  Anglois_Crisis.3.d:0 "Clouds are gathering in Quebec.\n\nThe recent economic disaster has started to hit Quebec in the last months and their government have not been able to fix the issues for weeks now. The Conservative Supremacist-Québécois Government has only enacted limited social support proramms for their people now. But not for the far more numerous Anglois population in the West.\n\nMost of the Anglois have immigrated from our states to Quebec over the recent decades invented by Quebec to settle in the sparsely uninhabted Lake Provinces and kickstart the industry. During certain times Anglois residents became war wealthier then the average American in the Commenwealth throuh low taxes and great economic oppurtunities. But other the last years these have begun run out and their situation has gotten worse in other regards.\nWith the government in Quebec growing worried about the growing Angloi population they have become more and more conservative and restrictive regarding them. Lesser voting rights, higher taxes, enforced Frenchinization at every possible oppurunity.\n\nMost Anglois still somewhat withstood these conditions as their livelihood where supported by the great industry in their provinces. However with the Economic Collapse and the Failures of Reforms, this has come to an end. Animosity between Anglois and Québécois is growing. Street Violence is escalating and soon the entire Midwest could be in chaos.\n\nWe are following the situation very closely. A situation might develop where we can regain our rightful people, new industry and ... new land."

With news of no promises social bailout and an rather untactful interview by Prime Minister Hamel, the situation has exploded.\nThe English-Speaking Angloi Population has risen up against their Québécois government and demand that the United Commenwealth intervene for their livelihoods. Violent Clashes are now underway in Chicagou and Détroit with more reports coming in."
