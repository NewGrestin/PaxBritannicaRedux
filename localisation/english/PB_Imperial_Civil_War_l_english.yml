  ImpCiv_Crisis.14.t:0 "British Loyalists Rise Up"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.14.d:0 "We're receiving scattered reports of unrest across New England. Several government buildings have been attacked and burned, sending secessionist supporters running. While the northernmost provinces have always been a holdout for loyalists, they were never this violent before now. British intelligence is clearly escalating the situation and activating networks of traitors who are willing to sell out the Commonwealth to London.\n\nWith the situation as unstable as it currently is, we can't spare professional troops to pacify the region in full. Local police and the RAMP will have to handle the situation as best they can."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.14.a:0 "Traitors, the whole damn lot of them."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.15.t:0 "The Bermuda Confrontation"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.15.d:0 "Escalations continue across North America, particularly in the Caribbean where the issue of Bermuda has risen to prominence again in dramatic fashion. As the British have refused to cooperate with American naval orders in Bermuda, Commonwealth Naval Command established an exclusion zone around the island. Ships identitifed as British have, until now, stopped peacefully and allowed search for military armaments. There's been some grumbling and a few spats, but nothing terribly serious.\n\nUntil now.\n\nEarly this morning, we detected a British submarine within the exclusion zone that had failed to identify itself. As per protocol, American destroyers converged on the submarine and signalled it to surface with low yield depth charges. Rather than surface, the submarine fired on one of the destroyers and damaged it before fleeing the exclusion zone. This marks the first direct attack by British naval assets on the American military, and as such our forces have abolished the exclusion zone and begun directly targeting British naval forces around Bermuda."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.15.a:0 "War is nearly upon us."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.151.t:0 "Our Patience Is Running Out"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.151.d:0 "We have waited for things to change. London and Philadelphia have both made promises to the American people. Talk of an equal and fairer partnership, a joint military and an increased say in how the empire is run. At first it gave us hope that everything would improve. At last we could earn our place right by the side of Britain in this Confederation. A voice to represent their Imperial subjects. That we just had to be patient. But now we see that for all it truly is.\n\nEmpty promises.\n\nEven the Americans who have achieved some position of power are ignored. In favour of those from London. Our loyalty has been rewarded with nothing. Dissent and doubt are whispered in the halls of government. In the streets, protests grow, English owned stores are attacked and there are even cases of soldiers off duty being murdered in their sleep. For the first time in nearly 150 years, there is talk of one word that was previously only discussed in history books as a failed experiment.\n\nIndependence."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.151.a:0 "Why are we even in all of this anymore?."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.152.t:0 "Negotiations with Britain Break Down"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.152.d:0 "This was supposed to be the moment war was averted. We'd sit down with representatives from London, hash out an agreement and avoid any bloodshed. At first it went well, introductions were made, hands were shaken and proposals made. The statesmen and diplomats talked, going over every point in great detail. But talking itself does little, only action proves it.\n\nAnd they took no action.\n\nOur concerns and demands were laughed at and belittled. We were told how London had given us enough, that we just needed to grin and bear it. Polite objections became passive agressive comments, which in turn became insults that finally devolved into shouting. Any drafted agreements were literally tossed out of the window and the men from London left, vowing that he'll beg for their return.\n\nWe say let them go..."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.16.t:0 "The Last Minutes Of Peace"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.16.d:0 "Flashpoints continue to spark throughout the empire. This evening, British and American forces in New England faced off and came away more confused than anything. Our report states that British troops were spotted outside Epping, an area near the rebelling New England provinces. Due to being directly marked as British soldiery, they were approached with caution. Despite this caution, a firefight ensued which left at least one dead from our side and possibly three to four on theirs, depending on who's being asked.\n\nRadio contact between British and American forces in the region has ceased entirely since then. Either the British have changed their codes or they're simply not interested in chit chat now. It's made it impossible to prevent conflict in the region, as no one is making any effort to coordinate. Shootouts are already being reported across the entire border, with both sides seemingly taking random pot shots at one another."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.16.a:0 "Who Shot First?"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.17.t:0 "The Imperial Civil War" # For AME
  ImpCiv_Crisis.17.d:0 "The time for discussion has passed.\n\nIn light of provocations from Britain, the United Commonwealth parliament voted in favor of a unilateral declaration of independence. The vote came worryingly close to a tie, echoing the first Continental Congress, but after some debate an agreement was reached. As of today, the United Commonwealth has severed all ties with the British Empire and urged her associated Commonwealths to follow suit. Whether or not they do so is ultimately up to them.\n\nNaturally, Britain has rejected this declaration and countered that America is now a rebel nation. They have stated that the declaration violated the Imperial Constitution and that America's call for independence for other parts of the Empire has violated international law. A diplomatic solution has become untenable, and the British Empire now shudders in the wake of a global Imperial Civil War."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.17.a:0 "Americans I call you to war, death to the Redcoats!"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.18.t:0 "The Imperial Civil War" # For ENG
  ImpCiv_Crisis.18.d:0 "The time for discussion has passed.\n\nThe Americans have finally exhausted our patience. The unilateral declaration of independence issued by their parliament violates the constitution of the Imperial Confederation, and that's not even speaking of their calls for rebellion to the other commonwealths.\n\nWe still have our loyalists, however, and these upstarts will be put down just like they were over a century ago. If the Americans wanted a diplomatic solution, they have indisputably made reaching one impossible."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.18.a:0 "Let us crush this rebellious nation once and for all."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.19.t:0 "Imperial Civil War Avoided" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.19.d:0 "Tensions have, strangely, simmered in the last few days. With the British government in turmoil, they've been unable to meaningfully counteract our calls for independence and the UDI. For all London's bluster, it seems the Anglo-American experiment has ended with a whimper rather than a bang.\n\nThe bizarre circumstances that allowed this have naturally created a national confusion, with loyalists and secessionists unable to reach a reasonable conclusion. America has gained her independence at Britain's expense, no doubt, but the circumstances of independence are bizarre to say the least."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.19.a:0 "Thank God."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.20.t:0 "We Are Victorious" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.20.d:0 "Today the American people and nation stand as one united whole, free from the yoke of London and her fading empire. Millions across the Coalition of Independent States rejoice as Britain has agreed to a ceasefire following months of brutal conflict that has taken the lives of many. While the specifics of the peace deal are being worked on by both sides, we can safely say that the end of war is now upon us. What the future now holds for our young nation is yet to be determined but our trial by fire is finally over. "
  ImpCiv_Crisis.20.a:0 "Land of the free, home of the brave"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.21.t:0 "The Ultimatum" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.21.d:0 "At approximately noon today, an empire wide ultimatum was broadcasted by the Prime Minister of the United Commonwealth, addressing her majesty directly.\n\n“I speak today in the name of stability, longevity, and peace, your majesty. It has grown clear that Britain is an unfit home for you. An unfit center for the glorious empire in which we live. It is a unanimous agreement among the United Commonwealth and its constituents that the royal family should move its base of operations to   Philadelphia, far, far away from any threats in Europe and the filth which plagues the home isles. A new royal   palace in which Your Majesty shall reside is being constructed, one that, once finished, shall put Buckingham to   shame. Should the weak, greedy government in Westminster attempt to withhold the Your Majesty from exiting to   the empire's rightful center, we and our constituents will not be afraid to use force and shall bring our troops   into London itself if we must. Informally speaking, we are already the center of the empire after all, and you   may be surprised to find who shall rise up in our aid. We, and the entire empire, eagerly await your response.”\n\nThe broadcast cut after this. Naturally, the royal family, Westminster, and all the empire was left in shock, reports of mobilization initiating all over the empire, for which side it is unknown, but a civil war is imminent should the queen chooses to reject this demand. A civil war which given the empire's massive population, could rival or even surpass the Great War in terms of scale and carnage, a civil war that, with America's grip extending just about everywhere in the empire, we are likely to lose. It all comes down to Victoria herself. After hours pondering, she at last came to a decision..."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.21.a:0 "There is only the British Empire"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.21.b:0 "The British Empire is dead. Long live the American Empire."

  ImpCiv_Crisis.22.t:0 "Spirit of ‘76" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.22.d:0 "Transcribed from the American Prime Minister’s declaration of war against the United Kingdom...\n\nThe time has come. For too long, the British tyrants have held us under their jackboot, seen us as but puppets to their whims, but no longer. After 300 years of languishing under their control, 300 years of being kept from our rightful place in the sun, the time has come to break free. My fellow Americans, we stand at the precipice of a new era, one of freedom from our British overlords along  with our brothers in this wretched empire who seek their own liberty alongside us. As Washington and fellows once said, We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, endowed with unalienable rights by their creator, so let us fight for those rights. Let us fight to the bitter end and should we succeed, let us go west and claim our nation’s birthright! God bless America. God Bless Freedom! "
  ImpCiv_Crisis.22.a:0 "The call of Freedom is answered at last."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.22.b:0 "Those damn traitors!"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.23.t:0 "American Spies blow up Railway Hub in Plymouth" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.23.d:0 "It was a dark rainy day in Plymouth. Another regular day in this Great War against the far distand America. Supplies were reguarly being shipped out of the Harbor towards the battlefronts in the Americas and beyond. Those goods arrive mostly by train and get organized at the overflowing supply depot.\n\nHowever suddenly the regular day was over. A shooting was reported near the depot. Militias and policeman began arriving but it was already too late.\n\nAn entire train filled with artillery shells blew up in the depot.\n\nThe explosion was massive. Houses across the city all bear marks of damage. The shockwave would even be felt near Portsmouth. It took 20 Hours until the fire were extinguished.\n\nThe depot is almost entirely gone. The damage is devastating with several critically needed supplies lost and dozens of men being consumed by the flames. The train was perfectly placed too cause as much damage as possible. This was sabotage that was clear.\n\nAnd it is now clear how orchestrated this attack. New the small town of of Newquay the Militias detained 2 suspisicious people trying to flee with a motor boat. After extensive interrogation the men revealed to be American Spies tasked with this attack.\n\nLondon is already demanding that the High Command commence a counter operation against America for this."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.23.a:0 "They will pay for this"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.24.t:0 "Sabotage Operation at Plymouth was a Success" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.24.d:0 "Reports have slowly been arriving from England. The Operation to sabotage specific Port and Fuel Facilities has been a success. While the Operation was forced to be reduced in scale we the operators on the ground were still able to archieve the maximum outcome. The supply depot in Plymouth has been blown up destroying tons of army equipment and devastating infrastructure and logistical services. This will surely be a good temporary hit to British supplies."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.24.a:0 "We bite hard"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.25.t:0 "Effect Event - Supposed to be Hidden" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.25.d:0 "This Event is to Execute the Ship Damage Effect for Operation AI - If you are seeing this please report it as a bug to the Developers. That Event is supposed to stay hidden."
  ImpCiv_Crisis.25.a:0 "Ok"

  ImpCiv_Crisis.26.t:0 "AMERICA ATTACKS SCAPA FLOW" 
  ImpCiv_Crisis.26.d:0 "The Americans managed to hide from our naval intelligence and send a major Carrier task force to the Western Approaches and attacked the naval base in Scapa Flow at the outbreack of the war. There a strong bomber forces managed to carry out a raid against our ships docked there. While the raid only managed to sink one heavy ship, it did succeed in damaging the majority of them which will take some time to repair"
  ImpCiv_Crisis.26.a:0 "Not our ships..."

  ImpCiv_War.1.t:0 "The Imperial Federation"
  ImpCiv_War.1.d:0 "With the defeat of the separatist alliance, Britain once more has triumphed over our North American inferiors. It is clear now that the decentralized model of the Imperial Confederation is simply untenable for the future. We allowed the American upstarts and their traitorous compatriots to grow far too powerful, and we paid the price for this failure in blood.\n\nThe Imperial Confederation will be abolished, and the Empire will be one once again. A single great unity of the Anglo-Saxon peoples, bound by common cause. The Imperial Parliament will become the single united parliament of the Empire, the local provincial governments unified under common law. With the stroke of a pen, the Empire is reborn."
  ImpCiv_War.1.a:0 "And this time, the sun will never be allowed to set again."

  ImpCiv_War.2.t:0 "Ireland Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.2.d:0 "Ireland, the closest former Commonwealth to the United Kingdom, has become fully integrated into the Imperial Federation."
  ImpCiv_War.2.a:0 "Very good."

  ImpCiv_War.3.t:0 "Quebec Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.3.d:0 "Quebec has been successfully integrated into the Imperial Federation. Quebec has long been a strategically important territory for both the French and the British and will continue to be a critical part of our North American territories."

  ImpCiv_War.6.a:0 "Excellent."

  ImpCiv_War.7.t:0 "Victoria Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.7.d:0 "The former Commonwealth of Victoria is now being integrated into the British Imperial Federation. Negotiations have been ongoing for several months, with both sides discussing the terms of the integration. The integration is expected to be beneficial for both parties, as it will create new opportunities for trade and cultural exchange, and will help to strengthen the ties between the former Commonwealth of Victoria and the British Empire."
  ImpCiv_War.7.a:0 "Excellent."

  ImpCiv_War.8.t:0 "America Integrated"
  ImpCiv_War.8.d:0 "The final component of the Imperial Federation, the United Commonwealth, has been fully integrated. With this, the Imperial Federation is now fully consolidated."
  ImpCiv_War.8.a:0 "The Empire is whole again."

Doing this will ease relations with America and might end the tension. But our America will grow even stronger... and who knows if they stop at Cavelier..."

Without Michigan they will have no supremacy over the Great Lakes anymore and will be too disconnected from the other Angloi States.

Nowadays the situation in Huron has become very tense with Angloi and Quebecois Farmers heavily assaulting each other. The Quebec Government themself see the development of rising a rising Angloi Population there as nightmare and have been drafting laws essentialy banning any kind of new immigration into the state.\nThe UC now controlling all of Cavelier and Michigan and having become the master of the Great Lakes in practice now see the oppurtunity to fully exploit that. Owning the door to the Great Lakes at the Niagara falls would be dream for them. Again American politicians are spreading stories about plights of the poor Anglois and attempt bribing us.\n\n"

Superieur is more then 90% Quebecois and loyal to the government in Quebec. The tension have not spread to this region.\n\nDespite this the UC has made shameful inquiries about the future of the region.

In decades they will gradually lose their right to write, learn or speak English. Rather then looking for their brothers they will be lead astray to see the north as their homeland and forgot about their blood brothers.\n\nCan we just let that happen?\n\nThe American People, Buisnessmen even the moderate politcians are all full of anger. Anger directed at London. At the Empire. At the status quo.\n\nIf anyone wants peace to remain between the two giants, he should begin to pray that his fortunes become true."

Furthermore we are not the rightful protectors of all Anglois people and have wastly more future influence on the Commonwealth of Quebec.\nFrom the British Perspective the Americans get satified and stay faithful to the Empire at the cost of just some unruly Québécois.\n\nPeace has been won in British Confederation."

From now our border in the north lies on the natural lines of Toronto, the channel of Sault Saine-Maire and Duluth. We have incorporated a region of almost 20 Million people and some of the biggest industrial centers in the world.\n\nThere are some concerns about remaining Quebecois in our provinces especially in Superieur but we are ensure that they will soon accept this new reality.\n\nA lot of nations now look at Commonwealth in new eyes. A Great Power on the Rise. A Great Power which can compete with Britian itself maybe?"

  Anglois_Crisis.24.d:0 "The struggle between Philadelphia and London has ended in a spectacular diplomatic victory for us. The Anglois in Détroit & Chicagou have been successfully dealt with and these territories remain firming in Québec's control. The Commonwealth's efforts to take over these areas have ended in complete disaster. With some of their politicians going so far as to offer an offical apology to our government. Let this be a lesson to any within our control, this is the British Empire. Not the 'Anglo-American' Empire. The British Empire. And the fate of its people will be decided from London."

  Anglois_Crisis.25.t:0 "STATUS QUO REMAINS"
  Anglois_Crisis.25.d:0 "Our diplomatic struggle against Philadelphia has ended not with a bang but with a whimper. The Angolis' dissent has become increasingly torublesome to put down. And our dimplomatic efforts have exhausted our political resources. The silver lining for this is that the Commonwealth has the similar problems. Any further attempts to deal with the situation could spark open revolt in the Angolis or worse, thus a compromise was reached. The Commonwealth would gain some territory in Québec but the rest will remain out of their reach. Though an unsatisfying turn of events, it is better than the alternative."

Despite the best efforts of our diplomats and politicians, the situation in Southern Québec has proven itself to be completely untenable. Our control over the area hung by a thread, with the American Commonwealth making the situation turn to their favour. As much as it pains us to do so...we have no voice but to submit to their demands. All of the territory they desire will be handed over to them. The crisis is over at least. We must do our best to win the next one."

  Anglois_Crisis.33.d:0 "“We’ll make this quick and simple,” the Brooklyn accent marched across the crooked oak table. Our Foreign Minister and the gang of American diplomats were at an elegant cafe in the upper deck of Ottawa, negotiating mediation after recent escalations in the Angloi Crisis. “Philadelphia is offering a Samaritan effort to bail Quebec from its devastating economic situation. Such an effort would directly strengthen the Empire's presence in North America, directly boosting you Quebecois. In exchange, we request a facile concession on our autonomy in the Angloi states.” A young waitress delivered the men their overpriced entrees. Pushing words through his sirloin-stuffed teeth, the American coughed “Recognize our righteousness in the Midwest, and we’ll excavate Quebec from its economic burden.” \n\nThe Foreign Minister pondered about the compromise as he observed the cloudy Ottowa skies below. Rejecting the deal would certainly keep Quebec rotting in its financial entanglement, only diminishing the legitimacy and power of the commonwealth. It would deeply anger the United Commonwealths, perhaps strengthening the imperial tension between Britain and her colony. However, granting the notion would provide the Americans more wriggle room to sway Commonwealth unity and displace Britain from its hegemonic power. In the case of an imperial divide, the industrial parks of Chicagou and Detroit would then be in the ownership of America, only further stripping away the power of Quebec."
