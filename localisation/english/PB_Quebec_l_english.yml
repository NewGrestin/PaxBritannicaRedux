  PB_QUE_Our_Little_Paradise:0 "Our Little Paradise"
  PB_QUE_Our_Little_Paradise_desc:0 "The Commonwealth of Quebec stands as a perfect example of enforced loyalty done right, if such a thing even exists. When Great Britain found itself under control of the entirety of the Quebec region and north western plains it now had to tackle the difficult task of suppresing Québécois resentment. Under the Toronto treaty of 1878 Britain granted the Dominion of Quebec almost complete independent sovereignty in a similar vein to the United Commonwealth. From then on Quebec has been one of London's closest supporters of a non-Anglo origin, however there is still those that wish to seek complete seperation from Britain's grasp."

  PB_QUE_The_Anglois_Issue:0 "The Anglois Issue"
  PB_QUE_The_Anglois_Issue_desc:0 "The integration efforts of the predominantly Anglois Steel Belt for the last thirty years has yielded absolutely pathetic results. Few Anglois feel comfortable under the Commonwealth of Quebec government, this long standing issue seems to be unresolvable and the calm before the storm can be clearly seen going two directions. The most likely is outright Anglois independence, under the British crown of course, or near absolute autonomy. If Quebec even tried to take a different route with a heavy hand approach its likely that any results will at best resolve the issue for the short term. With the world on the cusp of another Great War the Commonwealth of Quebec is going to have to finally decide what on God’s green Earth it is going to do with the Anglois people."
