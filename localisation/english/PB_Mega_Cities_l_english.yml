  Megacity.1.t:0 "LONDON SPRAWL - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.1.d:0 "The exact origin of London's Megacity status is heavily debated by modern sociologists; however it is generally agreed that the population boom of the Second Renaissance marked a critical shift in the city's history. Contemporary London is one of the most populous cities in the world, with the upper canopy of the skyline reaching nearly half a kilometer above ground. London is commonly referred to as a layered megacity, a term that denotes megacities that expand vertically rather than horizontally. Much of the population resides on ground level, or Old London, where pre-Renaissance architecture stands entombed by the upper canopy skyline or displaced by superstructural pillars that hold the former aloft. The Imperial and British Parliaments remain on the ground level as per tradition, despite proposals to relocate them to the upper canopy.\n\nLondon's status as a critical port in Britain and the centerpiece of the British Empire has led to a syncretic population. Following the implementation of Malthusian Sociogenetics laws, immigration became a key part of London's population growth. The population is primarily European, with significant minorities of Africans, Freedmen and Asians.\n\nDue to most of the population living beneath the upper canopy, English architects were forced to seek inventive solutions to the lack of sunlight. Much of London remains in a state of perpetual twilight, leading to significant outbreaks of hypovitaminosis D. By 1921, however, introduction of Vitamin D supplement to city water management successfully reduced hypovitaminosis cases in Old London by 30%.\n\nThe Upper Canopy of London, sometimes called New London, is the least populated section. The altitude of the upper canopy requires many residents to use supplemental oxygen when outdoors, and cool weather clothing is often worn year-round. The canopy is primarily populated by London's upper class and aristocracy, though some only reside there during the Summer. The cost of piping warm water and waste management make the London canopy by far one of the most expensive places to live on Earth."

  Megacity.2.t:0 "NEW PARIS - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.2.d:0 "Prior to the Great War, Paris was one of the critical cultural capitals of Europe. A genuine rival to London and Germania, Paris was once a notable example of horizontal urbanization in megacities. The city grew outwards over the course of the Second Renaissance, as the city center was too honeycombed by the Paris catacomb system to safely support vertical expansion. Pre-War Paris also played host to several notable architectural marvels such as the Eiffel Tower and a reduced size reproduction of the Colossus of Liberty.\n\nThe Great War would, however, be the demise of this iteration of Paris. The city became the only instance of military operations within a megacity when Imperial forces besieged it in 1910. French and German troops fought intense building-to-building battles for nearly three months before the Parisian garrison chose to surrender. Though most of the French forces followed this surrender, a small but notable number fled into the Parisian catacombs to continue fighting. German Tunnelratte forces would fight these partisans for two weeks while peace negotiations went on, ultimately flooding the catacombs with chlorine gas. It was during the occupation that the Eiffel Tower was shelled, resulting in a partial collapse and the deaths of thirty-seven people. Neither the German nor French governments have claimed responsibility for the incident, although German commanders claim the French shelled the tower out of spite upon seeing a German flag flying from it.\n\nAfter the war, the French government was forced to rebuild parts of Paris entirely. Combat and uncontrolled fires leveled whole swathes of the city's historic architecture, leaving tens of thousands homeless. The reconstruction of the city became a centerpiece of the French Popular movement, who sought to rebuild it as a monument to French resilience against the Imperial Powers. Notably, the Eiffel Tower was left damaged to serve as a memorial to the battle itself."

  Megacity.3.t:0 "FRANKFURT - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.3.d:0 "In the 14th century, Frankfurt became a free imperial city, meaning it was ruled by neither a bishop nor a noble family, but directly by the Holy Roman Emperor. Few at the time could have comprehended how the city would eventually become the seat of power for a truly unified Germany. With the coronation of Franz Joseph in 1870, Frankfurt would become the capital of the United Kingdoms of Germany, largely as a concession to the northern kingdoms defeated in the Wars of Consolidation. Vienna was seen as too far from the German heartland and German protestants, already dissatisfied with a Catholic monarch, wished for a more neutral capital.\n\nDuring the Second Renaissance, Frankfurt adopted the model of a megacity far slower than other major metropolitan centers. Instead of encasing their city like London, the Germans opted to push industry and megastructures outside the old city, feeling it important to maintain the architectural heritage. In this sense, Frankfurt is the primary example of a ringed megacity, where the largest metropolitan structures have been built encircling the old city rather than above it."

  Megacity.4.t:0 "ST. PETERSBURG - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.4.d:0 "St. Petersburg has a long history reaching far beyond its’ days as a megacity. The site of the city was carefully chosen by Peter the Great, as it offered access to both the Baltic Sea and the Neva River. The first buildings to be constructed in St. Petersburg were made of wood, but in the following years, the city's architecture began to change dramatically, as new stone buildings were erected, often in the baroque style.\n\nDuring the Second Renaissance, Russia sought to renovate the old capital and compete with the megastructure projects of Western and Central Europe. St. Petersburg faced unique geographic challenges, leading the city to focus less on verticality and more on land reclamation from the Baltic Sea. Radial construction akin to Frankfurt was also applied, preserving the older parts of the city, shifting the focus of construction outwards. In the modern era, St. Petersburg is a sprawling complex of industry and development, housing millions and continuing to expand further, practically subsuming nearby communities on the city’s periphery.

  Megacity.5.t:0 "MELBOURNE SUPERCOLONY - DOCUMENTATION FILE"
  Megacity.5.d:0 "Originally founded in the late 1700s, Melbourne was for a time just another city within the United Dominions of America. Following the reorganization and creation of the United Commonwealth, the city saw increased population growth, particularly from the porous border between the Commonwealth and Quebec. The early years of the Second Renaissance saw the city undergo a dramatic renovation as millions moved towards urban centers, urged on by the early megacorporations. Melbourne became the manufacturing capital of the Commonwealth, circulating trillions of pounds and exporting everything from cars to military grade weaponry.\n\nWhile industrial growth helped catapult Melbourne into the heights of the Second Renaissance, it also created a vastly overpopulated and polluted cityscape. Urban planning trended to the utilitarian and much of the old city was either demolished or buried under endless miles of acroplex housing or factories. The city is often choked with smog, the people forced into cramped living quarters, and poverty remains rampant. In particular, the city’s murder rate is one of the highest in the United Commonwealth, while other crimes like bootlegging and prostitution are commonplace."
