# Events #
  invasion.1.t:0 "Flashes on Mars Detected"
  invasion.1.d:0 "Astronomers at the American Astronomical Institute detected a series of strange green flashes on Mars last night. The flashes, believed to be caused by volcanic activity on the planet, have become the subject of intense academic debate. A minority of astronomers have argued the flashes may be artificial in origin, highlighting the odd green hue that is inconsistent with volcanic eruptions.\n\nSounder minds, such as Princeton graduate Dr. Richard Pearson have stated that these flashes are merely the result of latent meteorological phenomena on the Martian surface and are little more than a curiosity. Telescreens across the nation were, albeit briefly, focused primely on the astrological phenomena before moving on to other events in the news cycle."
  invasion.1.a:0 "How strange!"

  invasion.2.t:0 "Meteor Crashes in New Jersey"
  invasion.2.d:0 "Early this morning, a meteorite crashed into a field outside Grover’s Mill in New Jersey. Thankfully, the only casualties were a few chickens and a cow. RAMP officials have cordoned off the area, but not before a small army of reporters and officials swarmed the impact site to take pictures and film reports. IBS reporters have been running a non-stop telescreen broadcast, detailing every minute detail of the investigation.\n\nThe meteorite is strangely intact, and appears to actually be hollow, resembling a large cylinder. Over the last few hours, sounds have been heard from within suggesting it might contain some kind of live organism!\n\nOfficials have yet to comment on the events beyond deploying the regional militia, while academics like Dr. Pearson have arrived at the site to study the object. While it might be too early to say, it seems possible that the object is some kind of manned spacecraft. Some have speculated that the craft originated from the Saharan launch sites, or perhaps even from Russia, although it is still too early to say."
  invasion.2.a:0 "Is that thing...moving?"

  invasion.3.t:0 "Massacre in New Jersey"
  invasion.3.d:0 "Grover’s Mill was the site of a massacre today, with over sixty dead and dozens injured. The crashed object revealed itself to be a manned craft, though not of human origin. At approximately eleven AM, the lid of the object was pushed off by an unseen force. From it emerged bizarre creatures, resembling something between an octopus and a spider, sickly tan with great black eyes that reflected in the early afternoon sun. Officials attempted to communicate but were soon struck down by some kind of targeted energy weapon!\n\nThe creatures are now believed to have been the source of the flashes on Mars earlier this year. The RAMP have locked down the area around the crash site and evacuated citizens within a two kilometer radius. The Royal American Army have since begun to mobilize on the crash site, preparing a defensive quarantine to prevent the Martians from causing further damage.\n\nLocals near the quarantine zone have reported sightings of tall tripod machines marching out of the crash site, but these remain unsubstantiated."
  invasion.3.a:0 "Those alien bastards are gonna pay!"
  invasion.3.b:0 "Maybe the aliens have the right idea?"

  invasion.4.t:0 "Martian Forces Attack the Cordon"
  invasion.4.d:0 "Martian forces crashed through the Royal Army cordon around Grover’s Mill this morning, killing hundreds of troops and ravaging the surrounding area. Despite putting up an intense fight, the Martian fighting machines moved too quickly and outmaneuvered the American Duopods, destroying them with tentacles and heat rays. The Martians have begun rapidly advancing across the entire cordon, pushing our panicked troops back at every turn.\n\nThe country itself has gone into a state of complete shock. Thousands are fleeing cities, clogging up railways and roads and blocking troop movements. Panic buying has become a massive problem overnight, with stores across America being ransacked for canned goods and non-perishables. Riots have broken out in the South, Melbourne is in utter chaos, and the government can seemingly do little to stop the Martian advance.\n\nThe Prime Minister and his cabinet have been relocated to a secure location, but many fear that the Martians will quickly take Philadelphia and potentially decapitate the Commonwealth government."
  invasion.4.a:0 "Oh shit."

  invasion.5.t:0 "Expeditionary Force Moves Out"
  invasion.5.d:0 "Welcome to Earth, General. Our initial landing was successful with minimal damage to our forces. An initial sweep of the area showed that the humans had attempted to form some kind of barricade around our landing site. A short sweep of the heat ray has driven them back, of course. Orders have been given to begin offloading the tripods and ground units and begin advancing in all directions. The so-called capital of this pathetic nation is “Fillydelphia” if our intelligence is correct, so that is the first natural target.\n\nTripod forces have already moved out and shattered the American quarantine zone, paving a path for us to attack into the American interior.\n\nRemember, either we win this, or we face extinction.\n\nGood luck, General."
  invasion.5.a:0 "This world will be ours!"

  invasion.6.t:0 "Martian Cannister Lands in Woking!"
  invasion.6.d:0 "With the Martian invaders ravaging the American Northeast, few noticed the additional flashes from Mars until it was too late. A second cannister has landed in Woking, to the South of the London Sprawl. Most of the British Expeditionary Force has been redeployed to the Americas, leaving only a token force to combat the Martian invaders. The sequence of events has proceeded as expected, with the tripods emerging and moving out across the region, leaving nothing but burning wreckage in their wake.\n\nThis clearly constitutes an escalation in the Martian incursion. What was initially thought to be an isolated incident may prove to be the beginning of a much larger invasion.\n\nNonetheless, we now have a grave threat on our doorstep and we are ill-prepared to combat it."
  invasion.6.a:0 "Oh."
  invasion.6.b:0 "Take us to your leader!"

  invasion.7.t:0 "Our Forces have crushed Woking"
  invasion.7.d:0 "Salutations, Lord-Commander. Our forces have easily crushed the miserable hominids in the region and begun to move out to the surrounding area. Our prime target is the city of “London” to the North, which we believe to be the seat of power for this nation. Resistance is still present but scant, and we have already begun to process humans within the occupied territories as part of terraforming procedures.\n\nOur objective remains simple, take London and crush the British. Decapitating the principal state of the British Empire will throw their respective protectorates into disarray, paving the way for our future success in the conquest."
  invasion.7.a:0 "Excellent."

  invasion.8.t:0 "Martians overrun Woking"
  invasion.8.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the Martian forces have broken through our improvised quarantine around Woking. The Home Guard was routed and forced back by their intense attacks, which quickly overran the hastily entrenched positions. With the news of our defeat outside Woking, the nation has been thrust into a state of panic. Riots have broken out across the London Sprawl, which is attempting one of the largest mass evacuations in European history. Emphasis must be placed on the “attempted” part of that, as it seems unlikely the city will be safely emptied before the Martians arrive.\n\nParliament and the Queen have relocated to an emergency position in the North, while martial law has been put into effect across the United Kingdom. Anarchy reigns in the streets as the Martians have begun to push out into the surrounding countryside.\n\nWe must fight back with everything we have, or risk leaving the Empire undefended from this menace."
  invasion.8.a:0 "Bloody hell!"

  invasion.9.t:0 "Explosion in Tunguska!"
  invasion.9.d:0 "An explosion rocked the isolated region of Tunguska this morning, destroying a vast swathe of the local forest. After some investigation, it was discovered that a Martian cannister had crashed into the Siberian countryside!\n\nIt is believed the cannister went off course and may have been intended for either Moscow or St. Petersburg. Regardless, the Martian forces have quickly emerged and begun moving out to attack nearby villages. Their advance threatens our control of the Trans-Siberian railway, but the isolated nature of the crash site will make a military response tricky.\n\nAlready, what scant forces we can mobilize have moved to try and halt the Martian advance from the crash site, but it seems unlikely they will succeed."
  invasion.9.a:0 "Send the Army East!"
  invasion.9.b:0 "The Tripods march for Moscow!"

  invasion.10.t:0 "Martians march from Tunguska"
  invasion.10.d:0 "Predictably, the Martian forces crushed the militias we sent to contain them. While the bulk of the army is still on the way, this leaves the Martians free reign across much of Siberia until we can respond. The best we can currently do is rally our forces and attempt to prevent them from severing the Trans-Siberian Railway.\n\nThe panic in Russia is far more subdued, thankfully, and this has given us the opportunity to peacefully evacuate our civilians to more remote areas. The process is still slow, however, and time is not on our side. While the Martians may be assaulting the heartlands of Britain and America, we may be able to stall them in the forests and rivers of Siberia.\n\nWe can only hope."
  invasion.10.a:0 "The motherland calls for aid!"
  
  invasion.11.t:0 "Our Forces have Secured Tunguska"
  invasion.11.d:0 "Greetings, Commander. We’ve been knocked slightly off course, it seems. A stray asteroid in transit disrupted our equipment and we have landed quite a ways from the Russian heartland. This is unfortunate, and will delay our plans in the invasion, but we must make the best of a bad situation.\n\nA small mercy is the limited resistance. It will take time for the Russians to respond to our incursion, giving us more time to prepare and advance. Our new strategic goal is to seize control of the railways, which will prevent the Russians from supplying their forces in the Far East. Once this is achieved, we may focus on moving West and attempting to secure their capital.\n\nBest of luck, sir. Hope you’re used to the cold."
  invasion.11.a:0 "Perfect."

  invasion.12.t:0 "The Affluent"
  invasion.12.d:0 "With our decision to employ local collaborators, we needed a face for our new regime. Charles Edison seems the perfect fit. The head of the fabulously rich and immensely powerful Edison corporation, Charles was picked up from a processing facility in New York and transported to invasion command to be briefed on our offer.\n\nSurprisingly, he has accepted and is now the new “Consul” of the Martian detachment in America. Already, this has borne fruit, as we have more humans willing to become collaborator forces for our operations. As we have relaxed our extermination plans, having auxiliary human forces may prove useful for the coming conquests and ease our integration of the various human groups.\n\nAs long as Edison is kept healthy, wealthy and content, he will serve as a useful face for the coming regime."
  invasion.12.a:0 "A collaborator, but a useful one."

  invasion.13.t:0 "The Mystic"
  invasion.13.d:0 "With our decision to employ local collaborators, we needed a face for our new regime. Surprisingly, a figure approached one of our auxiliary forces with an offer to join. The acclaimed “mystic” Allister Crowley has offered his services to the invasion force. Though less popular than he once was, Crowley’s force of personality may prove a useful tool for our operations in Europe and beyond.\n\nCrowley has been appointed to the newly created position of “High Chancellor”, leading a sham parliament of humans chosen by invasion command for maximum compliance.\n\nWhile we don’t believe in mysticism or witchcraft, it doesn’t hurt to indulge local customs. As long as Crowley is kept content, he will spin the yarns needed to keep the human population happy as they are colonized."
  invasion.13.a:0 "Give him a fancy title and let him think he has power."

  invasion.14.t:0 "The Broken"
  invasion.14.d:0 "With our decision to employ local collaborators, we needed a face for our new regime. Nikola Tesla seemed a viable option after he was picked up by tripods in Kazakhstan. Underfed and clearly exhausted, Tesla was offered the position of Head Councilman of the new regime. Rather surprisingly, he refused at first, but a few hours of neurological treatment changed his mind. Freshly nerve-stapled and compliant, Tesla will serve as a useful face for our occupation regime.\n\nHis daughter may prove less compliant, but once she is located we can easily repeat the same treatment."
  invasion.14.a:0 "He's clearly too depressed to be a problem anyway."

  invasion.15.t:0 "Reports of Illness"
  invasion.15.d:0 "We’ve received some scant reports of illness among our troops. Nothing terribly serious, just instances of fever or chills, perhaps some respiratory illness. It’s nothing that we can’t handle.\n\nIn the interim, the affected individuals have been quarantined for study. Still, we should begin working on advancing our research on Earthly diseases before this problem becomes something much more serious."
  invasion.15.a:0 "Quarantine those affected."

  invasion.16.t:0 "Flu Epidemic!"
  invasion.16.d:0 "Calamity! Our forces have been crippled by the Earthly illnesses!\n\nWhat began as a simple outbreak of respiratory illness has spread through the entire invasion force. Our troops have been immensely debilitated by the illness, forcing us to slow our advance and undermining support for the invasion effort.\n\nWe must quickly begin research on curing this outbreak or risk losing everything!"
  invasion.16.a:0 "This is terrible!"

  invasionlogistics.1.t:0 "Reinforcements Arrive"
  invasionlogistics.1.d:0 "Reinforcements from the home world have landed, bringing with them fresh troops and equipment.\n\nWe can begin deploying the new forces to the front immediately."
  invasionlogistics.1.a:0 "Welcome to our new home, brothers!"

  invasionlogistics.2.t:0 "Seizing the American Fleet"
  invasionlogistics.2.d:0 "With the defeat of the Americans, a detachment of their naval force has been left behind. Though we never really understood naval combat on the home world, we can press human auxiliaries to begin refitting and repairing the ships to enhance our combat forces.\n\nIt seems naval combat may be necessary to continue our expansion across the American continental region. It has been advised that we begin researching naval technologies to prepare for this eventuality."
  invasionlogistics.2.a:0 "An excellent addition to our collection."

  invasionlogistics.3.t:0 "The Royal Navy Surrenders"
  invasionlogistics.3.d:0 "With the defeat of the British, a contingent of the former Royal Navy has offered their services to us in exchange for not being exterminated. Given the island is, of course, an island, we will need access to a naval force to continue the campaign in Europe. Invasion Command has authorized us to bring on these officers and have them train our forces in operating naval equipment. Desperate times call for desperate measures, as they say.\n\nStill, our understanding of naval technology remains lackluster, and we should attempt to advance our knowledge in this regard to prepare for continuing our invasion in continental Europe."
  invasionlogistics.3.a:0 "Their contribution is acceptable."

  invasionendgame.1.t:0 "Earth Lies at our Feet"
  invasionendgame.1.d:0 "The League of Earth lies defeated, the new regime has taken its’ lead as the dominant power on the planet. Humanity and Mars can now live in something vaguely resembling harmony, although things may become more problematic as the colonists from the home world arrive.\n\nStill, this is a victory for the species. The last planet we ruled over was left in ruins, one might hope we could do it better a second time. The devastation by the conquest does little to support that idea, however. Perhaps it is simply in the nature of empires to destroy themselves and be born again, perhaps in another hundred years this planet will be ruined by our conquest as well.\n\nThis is not the time for philosophy, of course. This is a time for victory. The first colony ships will arrive in the coming months to settle Martians across the planet. Terraforming has already begun in stride, though we may have to figure out if the humans can survive the new atmospheric conditions.\n\nMars has won once again, against itself and its’ enemies, and our future lies before us like the endless stars above.\n\nStars that now lie ready for future conquest."
  invasionendgame.1.a:0 "Today, Earth. Tomorrow, the Solar System."

  invasionendgame.2.t:0 "Humanity Lost"
  invasionendgame.2.d:0 "The League of Earth lies defeated, humanity is in the process of being exterminated. Our victory was achieved, but at great cost. This world has been damaged greatly by our arrival, but it will be left greater once the colonization begins in force. There are still millions of humans who must be processed, nerve-stapled or exterminated before we can call the planet secure.\n\nStill, a victory was achieved, and the species has been saved by the blood of a billion primates. Blood that our seedlings will be able to enjoy in the light of a closer Sun. Already the first Martians are being born on Earth, budding off their parentage and beginning a new age of Martian imperium.\n\nHumanity will be but a footnote in the history of the new Martian Empire, and our forces will march until the Kaiper Belt is crushed beneath our tentacles. The Solar system once belonged to Mars, and we will reunite with our brothers in the Venusian colony and Titan, and take our crusade to the rest of the galaxy.\n\nMars is dead, Long Live the New Mars."
  invasionendgame.2.a:0 "Their future is as empty as their past."

  invasionendgame.3.t:0 "A House Divided"
  invasionendgame.3.d:0 "We should have known when we came to this world that our civil strife would come with us. Once again Martians have turned against Martian, and we must defeat our brothers to see peace. Our new regime must be the only regime, it will allow no other. If we must spill Martian blood to secure the new home world, then so be it.\n\nEarth will be the battlefield of yet another Martian Civil War."
  invasionendgame.3.a:0 "Let's settle this."

  invasionendgame.4.t:0 "The Fight Goes On"
  invasionendgame.4.d:0 "The Martians lay slain, and humanity has been humbled by their invasion. Millions of lives have been lost in the Great Martian War, and for what? We slaughtered our invaders, liberated our cities, broke down the processing centers and burned the red weed. Earth remains in ruins, but we can still rebuild. The governments that fell to the Martians are in the process of reconstituting themselves, and likely in coming years this League will dissolve into infighting. For the time being, humanity has been united in righteous fury against the invader.\n\nThough we must focus on rebuilding, a contingent of revanchists have already sought to take the fight to Mars. The nascent orbital programs of old have been retooled into the weapons of war for tomorrow. As their ships launch for Mars, they hunger to bring the same devastation to the red planet as was brought on Earth. As the Martians sought to conquer Earth, in return humanity will reach out and conquer them.\n\nThe Second Great Martian War looms on the horizon."
  invasionendgame.4.a:0 "We will have our revenge."

  invasioncounterresponse.1.t:0 "The War turns in favor of Mars"
  invasioncounterresponse.1.d:0 "The Martian invasion had mercifully spared Germany, but we cannot watch from the sidelines as the world falls into darkness. In a surprise announcement, the Kaiser brought in representatives of dozens of nations from across the world and declared the creation of the “League of Earth”. For the time being, these states will unify their militaries and political apparatus to better combat the Martian invasion. In an unprecedented move, even the former enemies of the Latin Bloc have vowed their support, willing to lay down their revanchist aims to protect humanity.\n\nNaturally, the Martians have only responded to this with further force and subjugation. The League of Earth will stand against this invasion, whatever the cost may be. Humanity must stand against these invaders together, or we will perish as individuals.\n\nWe can’t be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We must be united in our common interest. We’re fighting for our right to live, to exist. We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. We’re going to live on and we’re going to survive.\n\nAnd we will make the Martians pay for every inch."

  invasionflavor.1.t:0 "Examining Human History"
  invasionflavor.1.d:0 "While obviously not relevant to our military concerns, several of our scholars have begun going over the history of this world. Prior to this desperate invasion, Earth was deemed uninhabitable for Martian colonization during the Golden Age of our civilization. It seems in that time, hominids spread and came to dominate this world, overtaking other major species. The closest evolutionary equivalent to us seems to be what they refer to as an “octopus”, and while intelligent to some degree, these creatures haven’t reached sapience. Perhaps once this world is conquered, we can attempt to enlighten them to our level.\n\nHistorically, humans have developed along similar lines to us. A lengthy armed conflict preceded this invasion which they refer to as the “Great War”. This Great War was far smaller in scale than the First Great War on Mars or the Fifteenth Martian Civil War that cut off the stellar colonies. Of interest, however, is how this conflict advanced their technology. Though they never developed atomic weaponry, they have developed a wide array of strange implements that mirror our own technological development.\n\nA line of inquiry that we must investigate further once these pathetic creatures are under our rule."
  invasionflavor.1.a:0 "How curious."

  invasionflavor.2.t:0 "Taking to the Skies"
  invasionflavor.2.d:0 "After some time, we’ve been able to get the Martian Air forces active and functioning again. Invasion Command originally intended to pack aircraft construction equipment, but due to the constraints of our travel method we were forced to pack light.\n\nWith our combat forces now able to be supported from the air, we can also now begin combating the human’s main advantage thus far: air power.\n\nFor the first few months of the invasion, the humans have maintained air superiority over our forces, but with the first hoverwings coming off the assembly line that advantage will soon be a thing of the past."
  invasionflavor.2.a:0 "Let's see how they like it."

  invasionflavor.3.t:0 "Processing Camps Established"
  invasionflavor.3.d:0 "The first Processing Camps have been established within our occupation zone, allowing us to begin converting humans into terraforming material. Said material, colloquially known as “Red Weed”, is instrumental in adjusting Earth’s atmosphere. The material is created by exsanguinating a human body, then processing the blood into a modified slurry which can then be aerosolized. This gas, while toxic to humans, promotes the growth of the terraforming material.\n\nThe more terraforming material that an area has, the faster the planet’s atmosphere will shift to something more suitable for long term habitation. While Martians can survive outside controlled environments on Earth, supplemental chemicals are needed to prevent long term health effects.\n\nUltimately, this will make the Earth uninhabitable for most existing species, but will shift the planet’s atmosphere to be more equivalent to that of Mars’ prior to the Great Conflagration.\n\nOur technicians report, however, that we will need many more human bodies if this is to be achieved."
  invasionflavor.3.a:0 "We'll need more breeding stock."
