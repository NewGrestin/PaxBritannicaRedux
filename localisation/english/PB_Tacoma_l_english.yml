Though under no circumstance is he the Father of it. \n\n One of the primary military leaders against the Northwestern Territories during the Seattle War, Wood would show a zealous amount of Patriotism:full heartedly defending his nation not only in battle, but also in word-valiantly defending his nation in all aspects of life. Though, unfortunately, the young Confederation would not endure this war. Following this, facing several secession movement and rebellions. The Confederation would techincally cease to exist, though through Leonard Wood's Coup d'etat and declaring marshall law, the ideals and dreams of the Confederation would live on through New Virginia. However, that was nearly two decades ago and Leonard Wood's age is showing, and many are wary about the rising force of the Radicals in the State of New Virginia. "

        WWW_Tacoma.16.d:0 " OBSERVED PHENOMENA\n -While no measurable neurological output (e.g., remote viewing, thought projection) was verified, ES-Delta did produce unexpected anomalies during three documented test sessions:\n -Telemetry Echo Event (4 Months in Trial Phase) Subject's brainwave patterns were mirrored, within microseconds, by dormant receivers in an adjacent shielded lab chamber—no clear explanation.\n -EM Pulse Discharge (6 Months in Trial Phase); Spontaneous discharge of stored current from lab equipment during subject agitation—believed to be due to equipment fault, but ES-Delta claimed, “...I overloaded the room.”\n -Personnel Contagion Event (9 Months in Trial Phase); Two monitoring staff reported vertigo, auditory hallucinations, and intrusive thoughts after prolonged exposure to ES-Delta’s signal feedback loops. Both were relieved of duty and reassigned.\n\n ADDENDUM; PSYCHOLOGICAL DEGRADATION\n -Subject's mental state deteriorated rapidly following augmentation; Developed echolalia, communicating only in phrases heard from radio chatter.\n -Claimed to perceive “electrical storms” inside other people, sometimes weeping after contact.\n -Repeatedly drew spiraling antenna structures accompanied by glyphs that do not match any known written language.\n -By late stages of Trial Phases, ES-Delta was diagnosed with severe cortical disintegration syndrome and total identity dissolution. EEG readings no longer showed normal delta or alpha rhythms. Subject's waking brain resembled seizure activity, despite apparent calm behavior.\n -Final recorded statement, whispered repeatedly; "We are the echo of something louder."\n\n -TERMINATION REPORT\n -Following the incident 13 Months in Trial Phase, during which the subject was found attempting to wire his own limbs into a junction box, ES-Delta was placed under medical stasis and permanently removed from the trial roster. Deemed non-viable for re-entry into public or controlled society.\n Subject ES-Delta officially declared inactive, and in Vegetative State. Neural Mesh Alpha remains stored in Containment Vault 9.\n CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\n -Though no practical Neurological abilities were acquired, Electrosphere represents the closest Songbird came to generating measurable environmental effects. The telemetry echo, while unrepeatable, remains unexplained\n -All research into artificial EM enhancement of cognition may be able to provide sufficient results under more contained assessments.. The line between signal and psychosis has proven too narrow to safely explore. Subject should not be referenced in future briefings unless cleared under further experimentation procedures."

        WWW_Tacoma.17.d:0 "INTEL REPORT: SUBJECT ELECTROSPHERE –  \nFile ID: SB9621-THETA\nDate: [GetDateText]\nSecurity Classification: TOP SECRET // ULTRA VIOLET \n\nSUBJECT: Primary Report on Project Songbird\n\n I. OBJECTIVE SUMMARY\n -Subject SB-73, codenamed ES-Delta, was designated for experimental trials involving neurological augmentation and artificial modulation of electromagnetic (EM) fields as a means of inducing or stimulation of Neurological and EM phenomena. This vector diverged from the chemical or sensory-deprivation-based methodologies of other Songbird cases. The hypothesis, based on fringe Russian and Montauk based telemetry theories, suggested that human consciousness could be amplified or "tuned" via targeted EM stimulation, effectively turning the subject into a living broadcast-receive antenna for unknown mental frequencies.\n\n II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: \nES-Delta underwent the following procedural phases:\n Cranial implantation of EM-reactive transducers and conductive mesh (designated Neural Mesh Alpha).\n Exposure to oscillating magnetic fields (3Hz to 150Hz) under controlled chamber conditions.\n Simultaneous stimuli from white-noise audio induction and stroboscopic visual pulses to destabilize sensory processing.\n Interference patterns recorded via magnetoencephalography (MEG) and full-spectrum RF telemetry.\n\nAttempts made to “sync” Electrosphere's EM patterns with remote targets (both human and non-human).\n\nSubject was isolated for 39 consecutive days under continuous telemetry in Phase IV trials. Reported subjective experiences included:\n -Auditory hallucinations in Morse code.\n -Sensations of “identity displacement” and “waveform bleed.”\n -Claims of interacting with "electric ghosts" in the modulation feedback."
