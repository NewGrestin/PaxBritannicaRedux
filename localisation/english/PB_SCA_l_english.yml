Most of the population consists of hardened Great War veterans and young determined souls wishing to bring about the collapse of the Anglo-American capitalist economic system that had failed them and their families. These soldiers of the revolution have marched as far as Halifax all the way to the Oregon Coast in search for better opportunities, under the leadership of the prestigious American general Smedley Butler. Butler was the de facto leader of the Bonus Brigade, made up of impoverished Great War veterans that felt betrayed by their governments lack of financial and social support. The Bonus Brigade Crisis as it would be come to be known as would see Butler attempt a revolution in Philadelphia with the support of thousands of veterans and general military personal. However, this revolution wouldn’t last long and soon enough Butler and his supporters would find themselves marching through the last bastion of uncolonized America in a bid to escape the United Commonwealth military, finally setting up shop on the Oregon Coast.\n\nThe §YThe Second Continental Army§! is a §RFailed State§!\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"

The result was the death of many and those who were the "lucky" bunch soon found out why the settlers of the old America failed in their ambitions. Whilst their greatest foe is the Commonwealth, second ranks nature and her desire to elevate the human struggle to the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nNow begins the greatest test of all, to see what it truely takes to break a man, and an idea.\n\n§RSic semper tyrannis§! is a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants".

With nothing but the dirt beneath his feat he has liberated the veterans and workers of the North American continent under one flag and under one people. Now he stands mighty and tall, as the undisputed saviour of the disenfranchised, poor, and needy, he truly is the American Cromwell, and all shall hear his name.\n\n§RSic semper tyrannis§!"

With this Act, we will make it a legal requirement for everyone to seek either further education or employment once they've reached adulthood, with some government aid to help them along this process.

To fill voids or even because they miss the purpose is can provide. There's nothing wrong with being angry sometimes, it is completely understandable, but it cannot be allowed to tear everything apart.

But if they try to attack, we must ensue that they will face unrelenting resistance. But for that to be possible, the people will need more than fanaticism, they will need training. To this end, we will ensure that all men and women of this fair nation must serve in our armed forces for one year, or at least in military industry or other forms of manual labour in the case of conscientious co-operators.

  SCA1title:0 "The Dead March West"
  SCA1desc:0 "The roads that many followed laid high in viscous mixtures of blood and dirt with the occasional sight of a corpse becoming the permanent spectacle for the trek. Once dawn came everyone prepared themselves to once again follow the dirt road left by the failed settlers of the old America. For those who were too weak to continue walking their fate was not so prestigious. They became yet another figure on an already increasing list of "who was dead". It was a blindly sight to see sons beg for their fathers to get up, and the age divide only worsened with much of the old laying claim to heaven, or hell. Amongst the red skies festered disease, rampant starvation, and a total dissaray of society. From three hundred thousand of the intial pilgrims only an estimated one hundred thousand survived. If the commonwealth so wished to chase after us then they would have all the directions needed. It seemed Hansel and Gretel ran out of bread, but not bodies, that they had plenty of. Even when Butler proclaimed our new home all one had to do was turn and look at those damn dirt roads to be reminded of what happened."

  SCA2desc:0 "The convoy reared to a closure, behind followed a huge line of hungry and tired peoples. The food situation had already begun deteriorating at this point and rationing had already taken effect. The streets were battered with sand and the definition of hell seemed all to fitting for the situation at hand. The local militias while not uttering a word of hesitance were all to knowledge about the current circumstances. They remained the only people able to still maintain a full belly, them and the various political leaders. Even the veterans were on the short end of the stick. The new Butlerites began being set new homes and rations and the core population looked towards them with distaste and concern. The worst had just begun. "

  SCA3title:0 "The Second Wave"
  SCA3desc:0 "As the second wave of Butlerites arrived the crowds that stood waiting at the capitals makeshift gates protested against the entry of more. "What about her, eh?" Shouted a citizen pointing at an old scrunched up figure. At closer inspection of the individual and old crested face revealed itself. "What will she provide now?" Added the engraged citizen as the crowd roared in unison. The old lady coerced with Butler showing to him a small timid boy under her arms. "Now listen hear dear, my son, this boy's father, gave everything to the cause. He died believing in you, in the revolution." Reaching out with her crooked finger she tapped Butlers heart. "If not me surely the boy?" She stood undisturbed at the possibilty of turning back, she knew her time was near but remained defiant at the suggestion of her grandson dying out in these wastes."

To aid in the escape, the Fourth Red Army stayed behind to help usher civilians west. The plan could only hold up for so long. Commonwealth forces have intercepted our comrades in Hardin, trapping them between the Illinois and the Mississippi. 40,000 soldiers are now caught in a mouse trap, 40,000 fighters we can’t afford to lose. A relief force could be sent but we are already stretched so thin. One cynical officer suggests sending “the unreliable” troops in reserves instead, but that would certainly be sending these people to their deaths…."

  SCA5title:0 "The Fourth Wave"
  SCA5desc:0 "The third army made camp on the bank of the Missouri, waiting for the river to calm down after a few nights of rain. Nearby, an encampment of Sioux warily watched the Europeans. They slowly warmed up, especially after the soldiers began trading ammunition and other supplies for food. Some started speaking about the cause and are interested in joining the cause. They have dedicated themselves to the march alongside us revoltionaries, it might be worth integrating them into our society, if one can call it that."

  SCA6title:0 "The Fifth Wave"
  SCA6desc:0 "As the sun set the Northern Army made its move. Consisting mostly of Northerners, Borealians and landless farmers, the caravan used the cover of darkness to get through the cold wet nights. Owing to incapable Navigators, the troops found themselves in the territory of the Confederacy. After some tense initial encounters, the commanding officer explained to tribal elders the situation. Failing to clear the air, the tribal elders sent a messenger, the troops will be allowed passage in return for compensation."

Seditious elements within our cities have begun to take action to hamper the war effort and force us to go into peace. And these elements has now begun to appear within our own military, as anti-Commonwealth insurgents began to encourage defection within our ranks. And just a few days ago, this has reached our command. As two of our generals, presumably having made contact with the SCA, have deserted their post. Frontline units claim to have seen them making a break for the SCA's defences. As far as we can tell, this effort was successful./nFollowing this incident, it is recommended that security and ideological screening of our command staff be increased."

Though it is said that the light that burns half as bright burns half as long, you have broke this mould. You've burned bright and burned long. Showing the world that the Jacobin ideology is some just confined to Trade Unions and the grumbling of old men, but a true force for change. And as you seek spread this ideology to the rest of the world, liberating the people, we understand that you wish to work closely with our government. We are happy to accept this offer, and announce the creation of the Global Revolutionary Front, with the goal of breaking the shackles of Imperialism across the world.

  SCA20title:0 "The Capital Question"
  SCA20desc:0 "With the Commonwealth defeated and the Eastern Seaboard liberated, we must continue our efforts at consolidation and building our legitimacy as a nation. And a good step on this path is selecting a new permanent capital. There are three options available to us./nThe first is New York, with its vital ports and access to the sea, it is a major trade hub. Setting up our capital here would place our seat of government in the very heart of our supply chain. Allowing goods to more easily reach us to be distributed./nOur second option is Boston, though not quite as large a trade up as New York, this city does serve as the cultural and ceremonial heart of our nation. This was one of the sites of our forefathers initial efforts to break away from the British. It is integral to our history and identity. Selecting this as our capital would be seen as us honouring our predecessors and celebrating the success of their dream./nAnd finally is Melbourne. The city serves as a major seat of Industry, surrounded by factories and the people who work within them. If chosen as our capital, we will sit as our nation's industrial heart and show our commitment to the liberation of the workers. "

A well placed blow will easily dismantle the solid-looking structure, like a house removed its foundations. The revolutionary must, then, use his small numbers in his own favour. Where trucks and trains cannot travel, he hides, living in the forested valleys and rugged terrain. His small numbers mean his diet can be sustained easily by remaining rations and wild game. Then, when the moment arises, he leaves his stronghold to engage with his foes below. Never directly attacking, he picks off his enemies at a distance. A sniper takes out a lone patrolman, a trapper cripples a scout: the revolutionary fighter must take the mindset he is hunting and stalking his enemy like he would any other animal, as he slowly withers their forces away through constant battles of attrition."

Taking careful aim, Uncle Ho scoped over the boulevard. Everyone else had since left, even the animals seemed to avoid the place now. What a change a small while made; the first time the reds came to town the townspeople welcomed them, gave them food and warmth, and tended to their sick and dying. Back then the town was still lively, bustling with the shouts of shopkeepers and cries of horses. But then the shops were “liberated”, the horses “requisitioned” and the people “resettled”.

Another method of capitalist control less mentioned, but still instrumental in their continued oppression of the working classes, is the slavery of consumsion. These dirty luxuries of pornography, gambling, drink, and drugs keep the working man docile and easily controllable, unwilling to rebel if it means his illusionary prosperity would be disrupted or his addictions cut off. It is for this reason that these vices must be eliminated, to complete the social revolution and completely free the working classes from their chains. Effective immediately, all bars will be closed and transformed into “worker’s clubs”. All non-industrial alcohol will be seized and destroyed. Only a wholesome and revolutionary worker’s culture will be permitted to exist in these places. Then following, drug dens and brothels will be similarly closed and the clientele arrested.

We didn't watch it happen, for we had to keep moving lest we suffer the same fate, but the last time I heard him was when he screamed, mauled to death by wolves shortly after. I want to come home. To you. To father. To all my friends. But I'm too far gone now. I can't come home. I'd be shot as soon as the authorities saw me. This may be my last letter to you, if you even receive it.

Only on a few occasions did he spare the time to take a break from the poison that was ruining his life, although the where abouts of Jacob during such times remained a mystery until one early Sunday morning. Down a busy street amongst the foolery of Continental troops returning from battle could one see Jacob, passing a few notes to a munitions guard in return for an unknown object. It would later be revealed that Jacob had, by some way, managed to obtain a barely conceivable image of his family back in Philadelphia. What strings Jacob had to pull just to get such an object through the United Commonwealth, let alone in Continental hands has been left up to speculation. Unfortunately, a few days later Jacob had committed suicide after finding out from Continental troops stationed within the town that both his wife and two daughters hadn’t made it through the chaos of the trek west, and that more than likely they had died during the Mississippi river crossing.

Mr. Smith then stated that the boat was heading back to Japan but nothing more was known of Butlers intentions or what the Japanese government would do exactly with him. Some government ministers believe that Japan will host a Jacobin American government in exile with Smedley Butler as a leading figure. It was also confirmed that a number of Butler’s closest allies were also on that boat however Mr. Smith stated that the family didn’t safeguard any other individuals of interest other than Butler.

The Prime Minister himself, [AME.GetLeader], had read a short letter by an American soldier who had witnessed the barbarity of Continental troops towards innocent Trekker families. The letter contained rather descriptive language of the actions conducted by such tyrannic armies and had nearly brought the Prime Minister to tears.\n\nEventually the moment everyone had been waiting for had finally arrived, after a few short words by members of the committee for war crime affairs Butler was allowed to share some final moments with the America people by reading out loud a heavily edited speech. “American’s I have failed not only as leader and a general, but as an American. I hope whatever is to come of my defeat that you find it in your hearts to forgive the actions I and my armies have committed. Today marks a turning point in the history not only of this great nation and its peoples, but also the globe.
