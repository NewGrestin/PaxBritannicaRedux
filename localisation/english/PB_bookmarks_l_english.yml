 PAX_BRITANNICA_EUROPE:0 "The Shattered Continent"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_EUROPE_DESC:0 "The old European order, so carefully maintained by armies of diplomats and politicians, was shattered in 1905 by the Great War. Europe once again became the theater of incredible violence as millions died in the trenches, and in the end all that was truly achieved was the worst economic depression in recent memory and the end of France's continental power. Europe is once again falling into armed camps, all that's needed now is a spark to light the powderkeg\n\nThe Shattered Continent contains fully playable content for: Imperial Britain, United Kingdoms Of Germany, Republic Of France"
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_AMERICA:0 "The American Peril"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_AMERICA_DESC:0 "Untouched, uncivilized, and untamed, North America truly is the last bastion of the New World. The roars of trains fill the air mighty and high and westernization creeps ever slowly to the divided communities of the Great West. The Empire of Mexico and the United Commonwealth will force it, even if mother nature plans on kicking and screaming on her way down. Unless some other unaccounted variable can tip the scales\n\nThe American Peril contains fully playable content for: United Commonwealth, Second Continental Army and minor content for the Empire of Mexico"
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_RUSSIA:0 "The Russian Twilight"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_RUSSIA_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire is the largest nation on God's green Earth. Spanning three continents, home to millions of various peoples and faiths, Russia has truely reached the peak of the Victorian epoch alongside their Anglo rivals. Democracy, Empire, and Technology has allowed Russia to compete on the world stage, but some believe these tenets that the nation holds true may also be its downfall, only time will tell\n\nThe Russian Twilight will contain fully playable content for: Russian Empire, Independent State Of Prussia"
 
 PAX_BRITANNICA_ASIA:0 "The Suffering East"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_ASIA_DESC:0 "The East has for long remained under the subject of European colonial interests. Corporation and state have grown fat off the Asia's vast riches, but the tides of change are approaching. A flame of revolution burns bright in Tokyo, China is determined to become the centre of this tormented Earth, and the rest of Asia beckons between giants. Asia and its people will either forge a new legacy or remain slaves to the old\n\nThe Suffering East will contain fully playable content for: Republic of Japan, Empire of Great Qing, National Revolutionary Alliance" 

 PAX_BRITANNICA_MEDITERRANEAN:0 "The Latin Battlefield"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_MEDITERRANEAN_DESC:0 "The Latin nations of Italy and Spain have a rich history tightly intertwined with the history of Europe. Iberia was the birthplace of colonialism and Italy remains the cultural pillar of the Latin speaking world. However, both these landmasses have endured the unfortunate realities of war, strife, revolution, and any other great horror mankind is capable of. But there is hope, Europe is once again going down the path of war, and Iberia and Italy must decide the future legacy of its people\n\nThe Latin Battlefield will contain fully playable content for: Kingdom of Italy, Holy Order of Spain, Divine Kingdom of Portugal"

 PAX_BRITANNICA_BALKANS:0 "The Greatest Powderkeg"
 PAX_BRITANNICA_BALKANS_DESC:0 "How does one begin to describe the history of the Balkans? War? Art? Culture? Empire? Is it not all these things and more? Whatever the case may be the Balkans has remained a hot bed of European geopolitical interests. Greece has seemingly carved itself a new empire, inspired by the ideals of both the old and new. Hungary stands alone and surrounded, building itself a revolution against an enemy with no face. Serbia bides it’s time for the wanting of Balkan domination, a reality that soon may come true\n\nThe Greatest Powderkeg will contain fully playable content for: Kingdom of Greece, Kingdom Of Greater Serbia, Hungarian Common Republic"

 #Europe
 ENG_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The British Empire, once the undisputed ruler of the world, stands at the weakest point in their long history. The Great War broke the old Concert of Europe, once so dutifully maintained by diplomats and leaders. Britain, caught up in the conflict, sacrificed millions of their soldiers across the French and Iberian fronts. While Europe languished in their postwar depression, Britain retreated into isolationism, relying on an increasingly disfunctional system of imperial trade. With their Imperial Confederation appearing archaic and the Constituent Commonwealths more assertive, Britain faces a myriad of threats with and without."
 FRA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Rising from the ashes of their catastrophic defeat in the Great War, France is a nation reborn. The failures of the Bourbon dynasty have paved the way for the rise of ultranationalist fervor. Germany and Britain have suffered weakness and failure, while the peoples of France waited, regaining their strength. Under the guiding hand of Grand Marshall Doriot, France is once again able to stand up to the perfidious Germans and reclaim her rightful place as Europe's dominant power."
 GER_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The United Kingdoms of Germany are in the center of Europe and so influenced by all. With victory in the Great War Germany finally became the second strongest colonial power and had a chance to create great impacts on history such as Britian and Russia. However after the war, failures, mistakes and missed opportunities cost the United Kingdoms great deals of influence and power. Germany is the center point of Europe, enrishing itself in all the different traditions and trends around the world, experiencing another political lockdown and suffering another economic crises. Germany needs to change to have chance of returning to stability ... No ... to survive the impending hell."

 #America
 AME_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "America emerged from the Great War as an ascendant power, Commonwealth troops critically serving across multiple fronts. In truth, victory was something of a revelation for the American people, discovering that not only could they fight on an equal playing field as Britain, but even succeed it.\n\nNow the American Peril looms across a divided Empire, threatening to break the uneasy peace in the most critical moment. The Commonwealth will be a global power, the only question now is if that power will be bought in the trenches or imperial parliament."
 SCA_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "VERY IMPORTANT: The Second Continental Army isn't playable at game start. To play them do the following, *Complete the United Commonwealth Focus: Escalation Dominance*.\n\nBuilt off the back of retired veterans from the Great War under the leadership of Butler, the SCA is a nation ready to do what is needed to ensure a fair and equal America. Every man and women must ensure the liberation of all American workers. Although our great struggle will test the limits of our dedication towards liberation we must stay strong, for no one can understand the plight of the American people beyond ourselves."
 MEX_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The Empire of Mexico has by the grace of God managed to hold itself together since the days of independence from Spain. Under the Iturbide dynasty Mexico initially found itself as the uncontested power on the American continent, enjoying a large influx of new migrant workers and a booming economy thanks to the discorvery of gold and oil. However, Mexico would soon discovered that its believed hegemony over the Americas was little more than a quickly fading dream. Mexico must now face its demons of the past if she wishes to last in this new and ever changing world."

 #Russia
 RUS_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire is the largest contiguous land empire on Earth in 1933; a multi-ethnic empire spanning from the Baltic to the Pacific. The reforms of Alexander II paved the way for Russia during the beginning of the Second Renaissance, but came to a crashing halt with the outbreak of the Great War.\n\nRussia now stands, bloodied but unbowed, and faces an uncertain future as their former German and British allies now stand opposeed to them. The future will belong to the Russian Empire, even if it has to alter itself irreversibly to achieve it." 
 PRS_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "The Independent State of Prussia, simply Prussia, has been ruled by the Vaterland Front for the past decade. The ultranationalist regime under Philipp Bouhler has been slowly readying the state for the eventual coming war that will grip not only the soul of Europe, but that of the globe. Whilst the Anglo-German hegemonies might be too blind to see that Europe has boarded a one way trip straight to war Prussia and its peoples' have long awaited for the moment where they could finally prove to the world the true capabilities of Prussia's eternal glory.
