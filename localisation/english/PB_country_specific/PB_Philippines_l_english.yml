  PB_Idea_PHI_Rebellion_desc:0 "\n\n£GFX_TT_War_Of_Liberation\n\n\n\nFrom 1896 to the present day, no foreign occupier—whether Spanish, British, German, or otherwise — has ever found peace in these lands. Relentless warfare has rendered any standing infrastructure temporary at best. To each soldier who marches toward Manila, peace will remain an unattainable dream, and sleep a fleeting luxury. To each soldier who marches in its defense, freedom will not be obtained by simply defending those you love. And to anyone who marches at all?, they must be prepared to leap into the abyss."

  PB_Idea_PHI_Mexicandive_desc:0 "\n\n£GFX_TT_201st_Squadron\n\n\n\nIn the midst of The Great War, as former Spanish colonies fell into disarray, Mexico saw an opportunity to assert itself. With the dream of restoring the Galleon Trade and expanding its influence, Mexico began funneling weapons and sending air squadrons to support the Philippine Revolution. driven by a desire to gain a foothold in the Pacific and re-establish Mexico’s imperial ambitions, hoping to resurrect a glorious past long lost. In the end, Mexico’s efforts would bear little fruit. The grand gamble to reassert its imperial ambitions through the Philippine Revolution collapsed under its own weight. The homeland, already in disarray, was unable to sustain the program. Resources dried up, and the Mexican planes that once soared over the skies in support of the revolution now lay dormant on forgotten airstrips, gathering dust."

Despite the many successes of its northern neighbors, if the Asian race is to truly seek its own destiny, its first flower, before many others, must finally be ready to bloom."

  POLITICS_TEJEROS_DESC:0 "\n\n£GFX_ideology_neo_imperialist_banner\n\n\n\n§HFounded 22/3/1897§!\nThe §YTejeros Convention§! was convened to establish a §Yunified national government§! for the revolution, following the failure of the §YImus Assembly§! to resolve the organizational dispute between the rival factions of the §OMagdalo§! and §OMagdiwang§!. The goal was to replace the §RKatipunan§! with a more centralized revolutionary authority. \n\nIn a landslide victory, §YEmilio Aguinaldo§! of the §OMagdalo§! faction was elected as president. However, the §YKatipunan Supreme Council§!, aligned with the §OMagdiwang§!, decried the election as fraudulent, stalling the formation of the new government. \n\n§YAguinaldo§!, then on campaign in §YDasmariñas§!, only learned of his election the next day from his brother §YCrispulo Aguinaldo§!, who urged him to return and take the oath. §YEmilio refused.§! The next day, both brothers were killed at the §YBattle of Pasong Santol§!, plunging the Convention into chaos. \n\nIn the aftermath, §YMariano Trías§!, the elected vice president and leader of the §OMagdiwang§!, assumed the presidency as the §Y2nd President of the Philippines§!, sparking outrage among many in the §OMagdalo§!, who accused him of orchestrating §RAguinaldo's assassination§! to seize power. \n\nIn a desperate attempt to avert a full-blown civil war, Trías, opposition members, and most of the cabinet gathered at the §HTejeros Hacienda§! and §Rcommitted mass suicide§!, leaving the new government in a state of emergency. A §Ycoalition government§! was declared in the wake of the tragedy, formed out of sheer necessity to prevent the complete collapse of the revolutionary cause."

No more.\nIf Rabaul cannot pacify the islands and silence the rebellion by then,\nthe great Eastern Fleet will weigh anchor and sail—not in triumph, but in quiet retreat.\n§Runless something *drastic* were to occur.§!"

 philippines.t: "Zitronella Labs"
 philippines.d: "Zitronella had always been a research and pharmaceutical company—the notion of it being a simple, middle-of-the-road underdog Cola Corp was always a paid media façade.\n\nBut just how big the research arm was... that was far more than we anticipated. Our scouting teams only saw one thing after opening the main vault: a pit, 50 meters wide, with a single ladder descending into the abyss.\n\nI thought of throwing a pebble down to gauge its depth—before one of our compatriots, wearing only his shorts, leapt in. I tried to grab him, but at that point, pulling him would’ve only taken me with him. So I stopped myself and watched as he fell. It took about 30 seconds before any sound returned.\n\nI hoped—through the longest 30 seconds of my life—that I’d hear a splash, or any sign of water. But no. It was loud. And sudden. A thump.\n\nThe rest of us went down via the ladder. It took us four hours to reach the bottom.\n\nAnd by God—and I don't mean the guy’s dead body splattered on the floor, I mean *my* God—behind his corpse was a massive tube, filled to the brim with skulls. So many that the weight had cracked some of the upper structure.\n\nThen, a sharp reflection caught my eye. I looked toward its source. A pile of dust—calcium, no doubt—and nearby, more tubes filled with various orange, blue, and white substances.\n\nAnd in the middle of this hallway of tubes... I saw something that resembled a gun. I didn’t know what it was, and I wasn't about to find out. I swear I saw a potato on the tip of the damn thing.\n\nThen we got a distress signal. HQ was calling us back. Thank God.\n\nI was already planning to leave. And I’m not going back there—not in this life, not in another."
