  PB_Idea_PHI_Rebellion:0 "The War of Liberation"
  PB_Idea_PHI_Rebellion_desc:0 "From 1896 to the present day, no foreign occupier—whether Spanish, British, German, or otherwise — has ever found peace in these lands. Relentless warfare has rendered any standing infrastructure temporary at best. To each soldier who marches toward Manila, peace will remain an unattainable dream, and sleep a fleeting luxury. To each soldier who marches in its defense, freedom will not be obtained by simply defending those you love. And to anyone who marches at all?, they must be prepared to leap into the abyss."
  PB_Idea_PHI_Mexicandive:0 "The Mexican Helldive"
  PB_Idea_PHI_Mexicandive_desc:0 "In the midst of The Great War, as former Spanish colonies fell into disarray, Mexico saw an opportunity to assert itself. With the dream of restoring the Galleon Trade and expanding its influence, Mexico began funneling weapons and sending air squadrons to support the Philippine Revolution. driven by a desire to gain a foothold in the Pacific and re-establish Mexico’s imperial ambitions, hoping to resurrect a glorious past long lost. In the end, Mexico’s efforts would bear little fruit. The grand gamble to reassert its imperial ambitions through the Philippine Revolution collapsed under its own weight. The homeland, already in disarray, was unable to sustain the program. Resources dried up, and the Mexican planes that once soared over the skies in support of the revolution now lay dormant on forgotten airstrips, gathering dust."
  PB_Idea_PHI_FirstBloom:0 "First Asian Bloom"
  PB_Idea_PHI_FirstBloom_desc:0 "The Philippine Republic is one of, if not the first of its kind in the Orient — a shining red beacon in an otherwise feudal continent. Despite the many successes of its northern neighbors, if the Asian race is to truly seek its own destiny, its first flower, before many others, must finally be ready to bloom."
  PB_Idea_PHI_MasonNation:0 "Nation Forged in Fraternity"
  PB_SEAWARS_category:0 "The Asian Bloom"
  PB_SEAWARS_category_desc:0 "The Gains of the Colonial Powers in the Great wars have brought about a new wave of unease in the south east"
  PHI_War_Countdown:0 "The War of Liberation"
  POLITICS_TEJEROS_DESC:0 "\n\n£GFX_ideology_neo_imperialist_banner\n\n\n\n§HFounded 22/3/1897§!\nThe §YTejeros Convention§! was convened to establish a §Yunified national government§! for the revolution, following the failure of the §YImus Assembly§! to resolve the organizational dispute between the rival factions of the §OMagdalo§! and §OMagdiwang§!. The goal was to replace the §RKatipunan§! with a more centralized revolutionary authority. \n\nIn a landslide victory, §YEmilio Aguinaldo§! of the §OMagdalo§! faction was elected as president. However, the §YKatipunan Supreme Council§!, aligned with the §OMagdiwang§!, decried the election as fraudulent, stalling the formation of the new government. \n\n§YAguinaldo§!, then on campaign in §YDasmariñas§!, only learned of his election the next day from his brother §YCrispulo Aguinaldo§!, who urged him to return and take the oath. §YEmilio refused.§! The next day, both brothers were killed at the §YBattle of Pasong Santol§!, plunging the Convention into chaos. \n\nIn the aftermath, §YMariano Trías§!, the elected vice president and leader of the §OMagdiwang§!, assumed the presidency as the §Y2nd President of the Philippines§!, sparking outrage among many in the §OMagdalo§!, who accused him of orchestrating §RAguinaldo's assassination§! to seize power. \n\nIn a desperate attempt to avert a full-blown civil war, Trías, opposition members, and most of the cabinet gathered at the §HTejeros Hacienda§! and §Rcommitted mass suicide§!, leaving the new government in a state of emergency. A §Ycoalition government§! was declared in the wake of the tragedy, formed out of sheer necessity to prevent the complete collapse of the revolutionary cause."
