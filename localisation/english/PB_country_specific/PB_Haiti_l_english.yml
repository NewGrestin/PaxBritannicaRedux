  PB_HAI_1804_Legacy:0 "Legacy of 1804"
  PB_HAI_1804_Legacy_desc:0 "What allows the Ayitian folk to stand tall and proud despite the hardships? What makes him strong against the overwhelming forces of Philadelphia's imperialism and New Granada's savagery? It is perhaps the fact that every Ayitian knows what precedes him — and what could be should he not defend his homeland to the bitter end. \n\nFor centuries, our peoples have been oppressed by the Bourbon's slavers, and our very dignity of Men stripped away as we were considered nothing but dispensable assets. \n\nThen came the revolt. Leading the uprising of 1804, our forebearers would end up shedding the White man's yoke, fathering the first ever Nation free from slavery in America. A Nation that the uprooted and those once enslaved could finally call 'home'. \n\nDespite past corruption, economic decline and a regime having devolved into quasi-feudal stratification, the Empire of Ayiti has nonetheless remained a beacon of hope for all African descendants still oppressed through the continent. \n\nFor no one could ever question the titanic legacy of Toussaint Louverture and all those who fought in the name of freedom."
  PB_HAI_Feudal_Remnants:0 "Louverture's Untold Mistake"
  PB_HAI_Feudal_Remnants_desc:0 "Although Toussaint the First's paramount role in freeing Ayiti remain unquestionable, his propension to rely on debatable institutions as a way to build up the country's administration hasn't been without issues. The so-called 'Ayitian aristocracy' is one of these 'solution' our forefather thought would be necessary in order to keep the Empire afloat. After all, freedom from the slavers never meant Order and the natural hierarchies between classes had to fade away. \n\nIt didn't take long for this largely artificial Ayitian elite to entrench itself within the State and co-opt every institutions more or less related to it — from the highest echelons of the Army to the small agrarian plot itself. Such a state of affairs soon dissolved any sense of duty among the aristocracy: while the Ayitian farmer may have struggled for a living, the aristocrat would tighten his yoke even more, increasing his privileges to the absurd while the country suffered. \n\nThe death sentence of Ayiti's finest would not lie in their lavish lifestyle nor their fierce opposition toward any semblance of national solidarity however. By becoming increasingly wealthy, the caste had also became increasingly weak, and as such, reliant on foreign support. When the United Commonwealth stepped in, their complacency toward the occupier sparked outrage and anger — an opportunity that Rolsavo Bobo would use as a way to propel himself at the helm of the Empire. \n\nDespite the emperor's radical land reforms, the ghost of this parasitic class remains ever present within Ayitian politics. While any attempt at reforming Ayiti's underperforming economy turns into a sluggish trial lasting for months if not years, the aristocracy's hand remains mostly free — a situation which could end up badly should Toussaint the Third attempt anything too bold."
