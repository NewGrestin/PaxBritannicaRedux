  HAI_rolsavo_bobo: "Toussaint III"
  HAI_rolsavo_bobo_desc: "§HBorn 1/28/1887 in Cap-Haïtien, Empire of Ayiti§!\n\nWhile Ayiti's recent History might have been branded by the forfeiture and debauchery of its many emperors, there are some who, despite the downturns and broken promises, never forgot the struggles and ideals on which the Empire was first founded on. §YRolsavo Bobo§! was one among these wistful peoples. \n\nSurfing on a tumultuous Era of chronic economic downturns and antipathy toward the Commonwealth's intrusion in Ayiti's politics, Bobo would build his success upon the exaltation of a national romanticism taking roots in Toussaint Louverture's prestigious legacy. Drawing parallel between past Bourbon slavers and nowadays Philadelphia's imperialism would end up winning the hearts of both the chauvinistic military as well as a peasantry long-impoverished by the Commonwealth's unequal competition. Such popularity would allow the doctor-turned-statesman to take over the country through a swift coup in Port-au-Prince, ending decades of compromission with the “Anglican rot”. Crowned in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption under the title of §YToussaint the Third§! — an obvious reference to Toussaint Louverture's imperial lineage —, Bobo has since then been busy conducting several ambitious land reforms while enforcing his vision of a strictly catholic Ayitian land freed from the White man's oppression. \n\nWhile such radical policies contributed in rebuilding national pride and confidence in the Empire, it hasn't been without drawing the anger of the entrenched Ayitian aristocrats and British agrarian businesses alike. While his reign appears unquestioned for now, Toussaint the Third might very much be sitting on a ticking time bomb waiting to explode."

  PB_HAI_1804_Legacy:0 "Legacy of 1804"
  PB_HAI_1804_Legacy_desc:0 "What allows the Ayitian folk to stand tall and proud despite the hardships? What makes him strong against the overwhelming forces of Philadelphia's imperialism and New Granada's savagery? It is perhaps the fact that every Ayitian knows what precedes him — and what could be should he not defend his homeland to the bitter end. \n\nFor centuries, our peoples have been oppressed by the Bourbon's slavers, and our very dignity of Men stripped away as we were considered nothing but dispensable assets. \n\nThen came the revolt. Leading the uprising of 1804, our forebearers would end up shedding the White man's yoke, fathering the first ever Nation free from slavery in America. A Nation that the uprooted and those once enslaved could finally call “home”. \n\nDespite past corruption, economic decline and a regime having devolved into quasi-feudal stratification, the Empire of Ayiti has nonetheless remained a beacon of hope for all African descendants still oppressed through the continent. \n\nFor no one could ever question the titanic legacy of Toussaint Louverture and all those who fought in the name of freedom."
  PB_HAI_Feudal_Remnants:0 "Louverture's Untold Mistake"
  PB_HAI_Feudal_Remnants_desc:0 "Although Toussaint the First's paramount role in freeing Ayiti remain unquestionable, his propension to rely on debatable institutions as a way to build up the country's administration hasn't been without issues. The so-called Ayitian aristocracy is one of these “solution” our forefather thought would be necessary in order to keep the Empire afloat. After all, freedom from the slavers never meant Order and the natural hierarchies between classes had to fade away. \n\nIt didn't take long for this largely artificial Ayitian elite to entrench itself within the State and co-opt every institutions more or less related to it — from the highest echelons of the Army to the small agrarian plot itself. Such a state of affairs soon dissolved any sense of duty among the aristocracy: while the Ayitian farmer may have struggled for a living, the aristocrat would tighten his yoke even more, increasing his privileges to the absurd while the country suffered. \n\nThe death sentence of Ayiti's finest would not lie in their lavish lifestyle nor their fierce opposition toward any semblance of national solidarity however. By becoming increasingly wealthy, the caste had also became increasingly weak, and as such, reliant on foreign support. When the United Commonwealth stepped in, their complacency toward the occupier sparked outrage and anger — an opportunity that Rolsavo Bobo would use as a way to propel himself at the helm of the Empire. \n\nDespite the emperor's radical land reforms, the ghost of this parasitic class remains ever present within Ayitian politics. While any attempt at reforming Ayiti's underperforming economy turns into a sluggish trial lasting for months if not years, the aristocracy's hand remains mostly free — a situation which could end up badly should Toussaint the Third attempt anything too bold."
  PB_HAI_Racial_policy:0 "Scions of the White Man"
  PB_HAI_Racial_policy_desc:0 "The slaver's perfidy hasn't manifested itself through the tyranny of compulsory labor and mistreatment only. As if forcing us into submission wasn't already enough, the White Man spoiled our people's lineage as well. Such infamy led to generations of mulatto spreading throughout our land — the mongrel offspring and their traitorous genitors accessing better social status while those who hadn't betrayed their descent would rot beneath them. \n\nHow ironic fate can be however, when those who gave away their souls and pride for petty privileges found themselves rewarded with nothing but being beaten by the stick they thought they could avoid! With our grand uprising's success came a just reward for these bastards. From Cap-Haitien to Port-au-Prince, our bullets struck them dead as a divine punishment would. \n\nAlthough we never got rid of the mulattos entirely — leaving most of them alive and well despite their parents' deceitfulness —, a century of more-or-less pronounced stigmatisation and divide contributed in splitting our country in half. Racially-motivated politics is a common occurrence while the public and military services are largely avoided by the Métis — when they're not purely kept away from it through unequal treatment. This hasn't been without consequences for our relation with the neighboring American countries and Europe in general, which persist in seeing us as savages opposing the sanctity of their so-called 'master race'. \n\nFor the good of the Empire and the integrity of it against the imperialists, we might need to solve Ayiti's racial issue once and for all."
  PB_HAI_Two_Headed_Hydra:0 "The Two Headed Hydra"
  PB_HAI_Two_Headed_Hydra_desc:0 "To the East lies the land of Saint Dominic, an Hispanic stain on our home island — one which never ceased to threaten our sovereignty in the name of 'civilization'. To the North stands the United Commonwealth, Britannia's progeny and master of North America. Two heads of a despicable creature: the Hydra of imperialism and oppression for all the non-Europeans. \n\nAlthough our opposition toward New-Granada might be existential, our relation with Philadelphia is more nuanced somehow. While the United Commonwealth might have supported us in the early days of Ayitian independence — supplying us for decades so we could better oppose the French and Spanish slavers alike —, their benevolent attitude turned out to be a trap in which the lavish Ayitian aristocracy would fall miserably. Turning our economy into shred while enforcing their agenda more and more openly, the Anglo-Americans would ends up trying to stifle our independence under false pretext. \n\nWhile we might have successfully opposed such predatory ambitions, our mutual relations has remained glacial to say the least. While this mutual distrust gave some steam to the warhawk descendants of Ayiti's White exiled in Acadiana, we escaped the tragic fate of a military intervention thanks to the American government still considering us a valuable assets to keep the Latin monarchies at bay. Although we pride ourselves in how we repelled both the Bourbons and the British, the crude reality of geopolitics imposes us to thread carefully when dealing with the United Commonwealth. \n\nBut who knows? Under the right circumstances, the two-headed Hydra might turn against itself should we play our cards well."
  
  PB_HAI_Grey_Eldorado:0 "The Grey Eldorado"
  PB_HAI_Grey_Eldorado_desc:0 "Silver, the white gold so scarce yet so critical for the Great Powers, has blessed Ayiti with a miracle. \n\nWith massive veins of the grey ore discovered throughout the Northern part of our country, it appears our Empire was seated on a treasure all this time. Already, large-scale excavation procedures have been undertaken, with machine-tools and excavators bought from Tejas and Fordlandia reshaping the countryside on an unprecedented scale. Although we still don't know if such momentum will last eternally, the rapid industrialization and need for proper infrastructures has created a meteoric growth in our economy — all of it funded by an abundant demand. \n\nWhile foreign capital contributions remain strictly limited, and the Empire still predominant in the exploitation of the grey ore, the question of letting in outside investors is to be considered more carefully. Meanwhile, we can all but rejoice as the Empire of Ayiti finally emerges out of the slump it was mired into for so long."

  PB_HAI_Grey_Eldorado_military_mobilization:0 "The Silver Sword"
  PB_HAI_Grey_Eldorado_military_mobilization_desc:0 "While feeble minds would want us to waste our newfound treasure in petty welfare, circumstances dictates a far different approach on that matter. Although the imperialists may have the luxury of lavish spending, we cannot afford such excess while the nation's very existence is at stake. As our brethren still suffer under the Hispanic yoke, and the American danger remains ever present, our salvation is one forged in the armouries and the barracks of our Empire. \n\nEvery penny earned thanks to the grey Eldorado shall fuel our war machine and brings us toward the fulfillment of Toussaint the First's vision — one of a strong Ayiti able to free the whole of Hispaniola and uphold justice against those who would enslave us."
  
  PB_HAI_Corporate_agreement:0 "Corporate Agreement"
  PB_HAI_Corporate_agreement_desc:0 "Although the memory of Philadelphia's economic imperialism is still vivid , we have struck a deal with foreign investors among which English megacorporations are a key part of. \n\nEven though the Ayitian people have been angered at what is perceived as an assault on our national sovereignty, this accord should hopefully bring enough funding so we may further exploit the riches on our soil."

  PB_HAI_Social_Revolution:0 "1804, Fullfiled"
  PB_HAI_Social_Revolution_desc:0 "What allows the Ayitian patriot to stand tall and proud despite the hardships? What makes him strong against both the imperialists from without and the oppressors from within? It is perhaps the fact that every Ayitian knows he mustn't turn his gaze toward the glorious past only, but also embrace the future and fight for a just country as such. \n\nWhile the Empire and his cohort of propagandists might have tricked us in believing they represented all of Ayiti, this facade finally fell down as we understood the fruits of the Silver rush wouldn't benefit to all. The soulless corporations and the chauvinistic military might have received their fair share, but the Ayitian worker which had abandoned all for the promise of a better life suddenly found itself at the bottom of a new hierarchy akin to the one once enforced by the old aristocratic elite. Such subservience could have lasted for years — as long as the white gold would fill the shipment crates. \n\nCrowding us in their factories and their dockyard would be their greatest mistake however. What was once a simple call for dignity became a large-scale revolt as even the moderate reformist would suffer repression under the watch of the emperor's goons. Fools! By refusing any semblance of compromise, they made us stronger and more determined than ever! Now, they can only whinge as we occupy their palaces, trashing the ancient symbols of their dominion upon us! \n\nWith the monarchy in complete disarray and most of the populace willing to support us, we have used our newly found power to establish a Social Republic — drawing both from the Mexican experiment in California and the strength of the Magyar Republic in Europe. Although land redistribution have been sped up to an unmatched level, workers-managed workshops established and the equality between races proclaimed, the new regime should not restrict itself to internal politics only while African descendants still suffer around the continent. Only under the universal banner of the Republic can true freedom be achieved. \n\nThe Caribbeans and all those still slaves to an unjust Order are calling. And so the Republic of Ayiti shall answer in kind."

  PB_HAI_Feudalism_Restored:0 "The Ayitian Restauration"
  PB_HAI_Feudalism_Restored_desc:0 "The usurper has fallen, and so has his mockery of an “enlightened Empire”. At last, the unholy onslaught against the natural order of things has been halted before it could plunge our realm in further decay. Above the ashes of this existential battle stands the true inheritors of Toussaint the First's mantle — something neither the false emperor nor the unwashed masses' shoulders could endorse. For only the best and brightest may lead the way as our forefather intended. \n\nAs an aristocrat is nothing without his lands to oversee, we have reverted the great rot of the past decade through ample repayment and restitution of confiscated domains. This gesture of goodwill has granted us additional leverages on the aristocrat-led Indigenous Army, increasing our military readiness as such. \n\nThis state of affairs may not please everyone of course. Some have already denounced our rightful reclamation as mere thievery while other worries about our supposed acquaintance with Philadelphia. Lies and nonsense which will hopefully die out like Rolsavo Bobo's “experiment” did."
