  PB_SWE_Riket_Two:0 "Den Östra Rikshalvan"
  PB_SWE_Riket_Two_desc:0 ""Finns! Brothers! Your achievements are great, and the gratitude I express to you on behalf of all is just as great. – To interpret this would require an orator with all his skill – But I am a soldier. – Soldier! What a proud title! When I bear this title, by you – for you – and with you!" \n\n- §YC.G.E Mannerheim§!"

  PB_SWE_Swedish_Zaibatsu_desc:0 "WIP"
  PB_SWE_Not_Flickering:0 "A Flickering Democracy"
  PB_SWE_Not_Flickering_desc:0 "After losing the §OThird Northern War§! in 1927, Swedish democracy entered a limbo that has lasted since the ink dried in Saint Petersburg. The Riksdag has entered a state of gridlock that multiple elections have failed to fix, with last year’s elections resulting in yet another hung parliament. The Swedish people, as a result of such a state of affairs, grow angrier and more radicalized as each day goes by. \n\nIt will take something §Ydrastic§! to save democracy in Sweden or else Scandinavia’s longest-standing democracy will §Rdescend into the abyss and be lost like so many others have in recent years.§!"
  PB_SWE_Gustavian_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Gustavian Era"
  PB_SWE_Gustavian_Legacy_desc:0 "Sweden continues to be hit with hardship after hardship, and while recent history has not been kind to the small nation, its people find pride in the prosperity that the Gustavians brought with them.\n\nSweden's decline, having begun with its tragic defeat in the Great Northern War in 1721 was brought to a reverse by Gustav III’s reign, beginning in 1772. He not only put an end to the corruption & decadence that had begun seeping into the country, but managed to humiliate the Russian bear, sinking its fleet & reclaiming Karelia. \nThis would only be the beginning of his success, as he’d dedicate the rest of his reign fighting for the common man, & launching a crusade to rid the nation of its oppressive Aristocracy. In the Union & Securities act of 1789, the four estates' representation would be equalised, the government would be opened for all people, noble land would be purchasable by non-nobles & the power of the monarch would be heavily increased. \n\nHis descendants would continue to carry out his legacy of enlightened despotism & reformism. Gustav IV’s reign would oversee rapid agricultural growth, colonial expansion & the Finnish realm being put on par with the Swedish one. \nHis son, Gustav V would oversee major governmental reform, abolishing the estates system of the Riksdag, kickstarting urbanization & industrialization in Sweden along with democratization, seeing a steady rise in Quality of Life & birth rates. \nSweden’s position as a major power had been restored & it would have remained one were it not for the Romanov betrayal, enslaving our brothers in the East. \n\nWhile the future of our country lies in uncertainty, the prosperity & hope the Gustavians brought to this nation will not be forgotten by its people."
