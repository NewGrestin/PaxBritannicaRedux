POL_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - Restore Polish dominance in Central Europe\n    -Conduct experiments with Weigl's Ants\n    -Rebuild the Great Lechia Empire\n    -Implement mass surveillance\n    -Expand your territory through covert operations\n    -Create a futuristic state\n\n§YSituation:§!\n§YPoland§! in 1933 is a country of instability and humiliation.\n\nDivided and subjugated for nearly 140 years, Poles nostalgically reminisce about their glorious past when their nation stood as a sovereign power in Europe, comparable to France and Great Britain. However, today's reality is painted in grey shades (though many would likely describe them as black). Although the country did not directly suffer from §Ythe Great War§!, it does not mean that its effects did not reach here. The famine, thousands of dead young men and the §YWarsaw Uprising§! first shook the decades-long status quo, and subsequent actions by local administration and Tsarist officials only exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe post-war crisis, the reluctance to liberalize the political system, and active agitation of radicals among the lower classes created an explosive mix that was just waiting to ignite §Y1922 Uprising§!. At that moment, thousands of Poles took up arms to face the oppressor in a brutal and unequal struggle. A struggle doomed to fail from the outset.\n\nThe uprising left the entire country in ruins. The economy has collapsed, anarchy is rampant, and to top it off, one-third of the country is under constant Russian military occupation—a friendly reminder to every citizen of how dire the situation is. Many believed that the colossal efforts of the past few generations had been utterly wasted, but thanks to the efficient leadership of §YRoman Dmowski§!, reality has slowly begun to appear in a brighter light for ordinary people. The systematic pursuit of bandits, the fight against radicals, the development of Polish education, and the impressive results of the initial experiments with Weigl's Ants offer hope for a stable future. Maybe even a bright one.\n\nThat is unless nothing unexpected happens…\n\nPoland is a §YSecondary Power§!.\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nSprinkleskid, Tapir, Beige, Potanic, Gabgame, Ruminastro, Two Watt, Moune, and all the observers and contributers in the Pax Britannica: Enhanced server.\n\n"

PB_POL_PartyKiller:0 "Party Killer"
PB_POL_PartyKiller_desc:0 "The New Year's party at the Namiestnik’s Palace always garnered significant interest from royal dignitaries of all kinds. It was an event where one could forge new meaningful connections, hear the latest gossip circulating among the ruling elite and, most importantly, revel until dawn amidst copious amounts of the finest alcohols.\nThis year's event would have been no different from hundreds of previous ones, if not for two men who entered the palace grounds uninvited. They left a package in the courtyard and vanished into the night before any guard could react. The party continued in full swing, but as midnight approached, the centre of the city suddenly lit up like a new sun.\nThe explosion blew the palace doors off their hinges, shattered every window and crushed more than a few skulls. Amid the screams, smoke and fire, it was impossible to tell who was alive, who was already dead and who was barely standing, trying to keep their guts from spilling out. As the search for surviving members of the government and generals continued, eyes were frantically seeking one figure until finally, Deputy Prime Minister Giertych shouted, "My God!"\nRoman Dmowski, the father of modern Poland, was dead."
PB_POL_OurMenEverywhere:0 "Piles of Poles Fill Petrograd's Roles"
PB_POL_OurMenEverywhere_desc:0 "A humorous inside joke both in and outside of the Duma, this saying holds a kernel of truth. From engineers to industrialists, and even to Tsarist officials, Poles occupy a significant number of high-calibre positions in Russia, often arriving in groups. One Pole, sooner or later, will bring more Poles.\nDue to this brain drain, many lucrative trade offers and goods find their way back to the gates of Warsaw, boosting the local economy and perpetuating the cycle. While some experts fear the accompanying stagnation of Polish science, it is clear that the authorities will not soon relinquish this valuable lifeline to their homeland."

The cancer of socialism, the sclerosis of liberalism, and the madness of atheism are killing the homeland.\nDifficult times call for difficult solutions and tough people, who are ready for sacrifice.

PB_POL_LastHomelyHouse_desc:0 "In the Russian Empire, as in the rest of Europe, Jews are not welcomed – evicted from homes they have lived in for countless generations, expelled from villages they once inhabited by the thousands. The end of 19th century, in addition to significant technological and social advances, also brought other ideas.\nIn the darkest hour, many Jews have realized that their best chance for a normal life is to unite together in a community that will be, if not friendly, at least neutral towards them. Across the Romanov Empire, only one such place remained – Poland. Taking advantage of rights granted as far back as the 16th century, tens of thousands of Jews from all across the continent are moving here with their life's assets to start anew.\nHowever, the local population is not indifferent to this influx of foreigners speaking various languages and believing in various values. Street clashes are becoming more common, anti-Semitic marches are becoming more numerous, and even among government officials many would prefer a Poland without a single synagogue.\nDespite this, a delicate balance endures, and the doors of the last homely house in the east remain open. For now."

PB_POL_PartyKiller2:0 "Party Killer"
PB_POL_PartyKiller2_desc:0 "The New Year's party at the Namiestnik’s Palace always garnered significant interest from royal dignitaries of all kinds. It was an event where one could forge new meaningful connections, hear the latest gossip circulating among the ruling elite and, most importantly, revel until dawn amidst copious amounts of the finest alcohols.\nThis year's event would have been no different from hundreds of previous ones, if not for two men who entered the palace grounds uninvited. They left a package in the courtyard and vanished into the night before any guard could react. The party continued in full swing, but as midnight approached, the centre of the city suddenly lit up like a new sun.\nThe explosion blew the palace doors off their hinges, shattered every window and crushed more than a few skulls. Amid the screams, smoke and fire, it was impossible to tell who was alive, who was already dead and who was barely standing, trying to keep their guts from spilling out. As the search for surviving members of the government and generals continued, eyes were frantically seeking one figure until finally, Deputy Prime Minister Giertych shouted, "My God!"\nRoman Dmowski, the father of modern Poland, was dead."

The infrastructure of Poland has also been abyssmal, with our great industrial centers completely isolated from every other city and village. Trains don't even connect Warsaw and Krakow, our two biggest cities, with eachother. This unfortunate economic state has left us without much to rely on, with the Namiestnik of Poland often finding himself without any funding."

pol.8.d:0 "The investigation by specialists at the attack site has uncovered several new pieces of information. Firstly, the chemicals used to construct the explosive device were very powerful but also extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore, there is a justified suspicion that the perpetrators were connected with the Łukasiewicz Chemicals.\nMoreover, the investigators' attention was drawn to the detonator. Not much was left of it, but the charred remains strongly resemble a device recently developed by researchers from the Lviv University of Technology."
pol.8.a:0 "This goes deeper than we thought..."
pol.9.t:0 "New Testimonies"
pol.9.d:0 "Interrogations of witnesses have so far been of little use. The perpetrators were very quick and efficient in their actions, and none of the (living) guests or guards noticed them. However, a new perspective is presented by the testimony of a homeless man known as "Sweet Ignaś." He claims that while searching through dumpsters, he heard two men moving quickly around the time the attackers were leaving the event area.\nHe did not see them, but he heard one of them mentioning that his article was soon to be published in the popular magazine "Polish Weekly Graphics." This title is a prestigious scientific journal dedicated to the fine arts, so a detailed analysis of the authors might help in identifying the perpetrators."
pol.9.a:0 "Who are these people?"
pol.10.t:0 "Who Are Our Enemies?"
pol.10.d:0 "The analysis of recently acquired evidence has allowed us to identify the perpetrators with almost complete certainty.\nThe first one is likely Ignacy Mościcki – a professor of chemistry at Lviv University of Technology, one of the directors at the Łukasiewicz Chemicals, and a suspected supporter of Józef Piłsudski. He is probably the one who designed the disastrous bomb that claimed so many innocent lives.\nThe second seems to be Eligiusz Niewiadomski – a renowned graphic artist, professor and founder of the Warsaw School of Fine Arts, as well as a former supporter of Dmowski. There have long been rumours of his disappointment with the former prime minister, whom he viewed as a traitor and a "Russian stooge." A frequent visitor to the Namiestnik’s Palace, he likely served as a guide through its many corridors.\nDetailed analysis and testimonies suggest that one of the perpetrators, probably Mościcki, had an accident during the escape. The question remains, therefore, on whom should we focus our efforts?"
pol.10.a:0 "Betrayed by the salt of our earth..."
pol.11.t:0 "Chat With Professors"
pol.11.d:0 "The Lviv branch of the Security Office has begun interrogating Mościcki's former colleagues at the academy. Aside from learning a few insignificant rumours, mostly regarding the fugitive’s private life, one of the bomber's lab assistants revealed a very interesting fact.\nAccording to him, two years ago, Mościcki had one of his molars removed. In its place, he allegedly requested the insertion of a false tooth containing a glass capsule filled with cyanide. This information was decided to be verified through further interrogation of the fugitive’s dentist. Despite initial reluctance to cooperate, the methods of persuasion used by the agents led the dentist to confirm the lab assistant's statement.\nRegarding this new information, the utmost caution is advised when attempting to arrest the fugitive."
pol.11.a:0 "Always something new..."
pol.12.t:0 "The Contents of the Office"
pol.12.d:0 "A unit of the Security Office entered Mościcki's office at the Łukasiewicz chemical plants in Brzuchowice near Lviv today. Despite the bomber having installed a device intended to burn all evidence against him, our agents successfully deactivated it before it could hurt anyone.\nNumerous illegally accumulated chemical substances were discovered on-site. It appears that dangerous chemicals such as mercury fulminate and cyanide were being produced there. Additionally, aside from the plans for the bomb used in the New Year's Eve attack, another device schematic was found, which seems to be some kind of attachment for a boiler.\nAccording to preliminary analysis, the main purpose of this mechanism is to cause the instant boiling and explosion of an entire building's heating system, though its exact application is currently unknown."
pol.12.a:0 "These chemists..."
pol.13.t:0 "Intel From Hospitals"
pol.13.d:0 "A widespread hospital search operation has yielded its first results. One of the facilities in Kielce reported that on New Year’s Day, an elderly man with a broken leg, allegedly injured from a fall down the stairs, had been admitted. Comparative analysis of his genetic material with DNA collected from Mościcki’s apartment showed an almost perfect match.\nAccording to Security Office archives, the village of Romanów near Kielce is home to Leon Kozłowski, a key collaborator of Józef Piłsudski. Discreet questioning among the locals confirmed that after leaving the hospital, the man headed toward the aforementioned village.\nProvincial and national security services have been alerted to this new lead, and hit squads from other parts of the country are being urgently deployed to Kielce."
pol.13.a:0 "We got him, boys"
pol.14.t:0 "The Massacre in Brzuchowice"
pol.14.d:0 "A special unit of the Security Office went yesterday to the Łukasiewicz chemical plants in Brzuchowice near Lviv, where Mościcki was employed. It was suspected that the bomb, which exploded during the New Year's Eve party, was constructed there.\nTo everyone's surprise, as soon as the officers entered the chemist's office, a device installed there erupted in flames, quickly engulfing the entire facility. Over several dozen tons of chemically active substances began to burn, and the dark smoke produced by them covered the entire city of Lviv, causing panic among the residents.\nAmong the agents sent, only a few managed to escape with their lives. Needless to say, all potential materials were consumed by the flames."
pol.14.a:0 "Goddammit!"
pol.15.t:0 "Empty Words"
pol.15.d:0 "The Lviv branch of the Security Office has conducted numerous interviews in recent days with Mościcki's colleagues from Lviv University of Technology. Despite hours of conversations with the staff, no useful information was obtained.\nFollowing suggestions, various methods of subconscious persuasion were employed on the interviewees, including intoxicating substances, the use of specific ultrasonic frequencies, and even direct threats. The lack of results suggests either the existence of a deeply concealed network of saboteurs or a genuine lack of knowledge about the fugitive's possible whereabouts. Regardless, it has been concluded that further attempts to gather information through this way hold little chance of success."

Their lawyer, Dr. Stanisław Hejmowski, has struggled tirelessly to prove his clients' insanity, though few believe this tactic would be successful. Throughout the trial, public opinion, the Church, and government circles have made it clear what verdict they deem just.

Although the trial of Mościcki and Niewiadomski followed the full protocol, it lacked one crucial element – the defendants. Their stark absence served as a painful reminder to all present of the Polish state's inability to bring criminals to justice. As suspected, the accused were sentenced to death in absentia, and a special gallows had been erected in the square outside the courthouse. When two effigies of the terrorists hung limply in the rain, a sense of despair permeated the crowd. ‘This is not how it should end’ was the unspoken sentiment on everyone’s lips."

The normally bustling chamber had fallen silent, as dozens of gathered officers and officials listened in mute attention to the indistinct chatter between the pilot and the airbase command near Białystok.\n’I have failed you, Roman’, Jaroński thought, struggling to breathe in the stifling room. General Kutrzeba looked as if he were barely holding back the urge to vomit. ‘What have we done?’\nThat day, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers left their barracks across the entire Autonomy and began pacifying the rebels. ‘Time is up’, Namiestnik had told him that morning. Jaroński felt it with every inch of his being.\nTwo days earlier, he had been baptized again, told that he had been ‘reborn’ and ‘purged’...\n\nSo why did he feel so dirty?\n\n’Reporting readiness to drop the cargo’, the pilot's voice crackled over the radio. Everyone instinctively held their breath. Hundreds of kilometres away, in Lodz, history was being written. The base gave the order.\n\n’Cargo dropped’, came the laconic confirmation.\n\nKutrzeba vomited directly onto the expensive carpet.\nAround one million human lives had just been extinguished with chemicals.\nJaroński couldn't comprehend it. No one wasn’t capable of comprehending IT.\nHe had supported the Russians because he believed it would save the Polish nation. Instead, he had just buried it with his own hands.\n\nStruggling to steady his heartbeat, he began to pray in silence for the dead."

Though he had held his position for ten years, the military official was more of a puppet in hands of bureaucrats and higher officers, than a true commander of all forces stationed in Poland. However, none of those in power doubt that they are bidding farewell to a distinguished hero and a great friend of our nation—a man who, at a critical moment in our history, helped stabilize the situation and restore order to the streets... or so it seemed.\nAlong with the marshal’s coffin, a Polish delegation is departing for Moscow, with its primary goal being to find out who will take over the vacant post. While the final decision rests with the Tsar and his ministers, many believe that Polish input will not be without influence. The right candidate could help us secure greater independence from Russia. On the other hand, opponents of this approach argue that it might further embolden violent gangs and terrorists, leading to brutal actions not only against us but against the entire Empire.\nRegardless of whom we propose, one thing is certain—the newcomer will be far more loyal to Moscow than to Warsaw."

Surrounding him were the entire military high command, most of the government, and beside him, Namiestnik. The honour guard stood at attention, and a crowd of several thousand onlookers had gathered to witness, with their own eyes, the arrival of the new Minister of Security—a man who had never once set foot in Warsaw. In fact, he had never even crossed the borders of the Autonomy. Instead, he had spent the vast majority of his life hunting down guerrilla fighters in the remote peaks of the Caucasus. If only he were at least Russian…\n‘He is just the most ruthless, patient, and effective, and as clever as the devil’, the fat officer from the local Okhrana office had assured him. ‘The best man we’ve ever had. If he won’t bring order, nobody will’.\nThe Prime Minister wasn’t sure he wanted to meet this ‘best man of the service’ —let alone spend time with him during cabinet meetings. Even Ivanov’s presence had always been unnerving; a man who, with a single word, could have him quartered and tossed into the Vistula. The idea of working alongside someone who would do it without hesitation—and likely with pleasure—was beyond terrifying.\n‘Tough times require tough men’, his wife had reassured him the previous evening. Lying beside her in their bedroom, it had seemed logical. But now, as frost settled on his coat and the hulking locomotive with sides adorned with Cyrillic letters rolled closer to the platform, he was no longer so sure.\nWhen the train finally came to a hissing stop, its doors opened—betraying nothing of the monster that lurked behind them. The Prime Minister put on his usual smile and spread his arms in a friendly gesture."

The newcomer didn’t reply—he simply unfolded the paper in his hands about halfway through and began reading, translating from Russian on the spot:\n‘How is the general adjusting to Poland? Is the situation truly as bad as they say?’ He cleared his throat, marking a shift in dialogue. ‘I regret to say, but it is worse than they say. As much as it displeases me to admit, the Poles are sometimes less than civilized. The average Russian only hears about the loud cases—bombings, assassinations of officials, destruction of infrastructure and factories. He has no idea about the hundreds of smaller crimes that occur in the Autonomy every single day. Decisive action is needed to put an end to this.’\nThe secretary stopped reading and looked up at the Prime Minister. The latter merely shrugged and continued eating his breakfast.\n‘Big deal. He just wanted to play the star for the media’, he said, spraying crumbs everywhere. ‘Exaggerated a few things, that’s all. Hardly the end of the world’.\nThe bureaucrat remained silent and simply turned to another passage of the interview:\n‘Nothing comes without a price. Recently, in Saint Petersburg, I saw large red posters: ‘Seven bandits executed.’ They were everywhere—on every corner and every window. I said to myself, 'If I had to put up a poster for every seven Poles shot, the forests of Poland would not be sufficient to manufacture the paper’’\n\nThe Prime Minister felt half-chewed food slip from his mouth.

Regularly patrolled, with beautiful houses and expensive cars in the driveways, it was home to many government dignitaries, military officers, journalists from friendly newspapers, as well as foreign diplomats and businessmen. For this reason, this part of Warsaw was given the nickname ‘The Bay of White Pigs’.\nGeneral Wiktor Thommée found this label somewhat irritating, but he didn’t feel an overwhelming need to do anything about it. His children attended a new and reputable school, his wife spent time chatting with the neighbours while the servants prepared meals, and a small army of gardeners took care of owner’s lawn. For the general, this place was a little paradise where ALMOST nothing disturbed his peace. But that changed a few months ago.\nThat was when HE moved in—two houses to the right. A fungus that spoke in an unknown language, showed him no respect, and only looked down on him. Thommée tried to avoid him at all costs, but he feared that soon he would have to blind himself and rip off his ears just to avoid witnessing what his neighbour was doing.\nThe sounds of breaking plates and splintering furniture, the ear-piercing screams, and what sounded like desperate pleas for mercy—those he could still endure. Barely, but if he focused intently on the sight of his new Volga, it all became almost ignorable.\n\nWhat Thommée could NOT tolerate, however, was a naked woman running through the street, screaming.\n\nWatching the scene unfold from his kitchen window, he noticed the other neighbours at their own windows. Most of them were Poles—equally disgusted, especially since foreign diplomats were observing the incident with sheer horror.\nHis gaze shifted to HIS house. There he stood, half-naked, his hairy chest exposed, shaking his fist and shouting something incomprehensible. Then, he spun on his heel and slammed the door so hard that even in Thommée’s kitchen, the plates in the cabinets rattled.\nHe had heard rumours of what Beria did to women. He never wanted to listen—because he knew he would believe, and he could not afford to take that risk. If it had been anyone else, he would have gone to the Prime Minister, Namiestnik, the Marshal—anyone who would receive him. He was afraid, but this was something he could no longer ignore.\nHis eyes met the terrified gaze of General Juliusz Rómmel, who lived across the street.

Additional army units simultaneously crossed the Imperial border and are advancing in a long column towards Warsaw, which has been temporarily declared a territory excluded from Polish jurisdiction. Telephones, radio, television, newspapers, and mail are currently not functioning.\nMany observers and social activists had expected that the ongoing impasse between the government of the Autonomy and the Tsarist administration would lead to increased tensions, but all had hoped to avoid a forceful resolution. As it turns out, that was not the case.\nIn an afternoon statement, the chairman of the Russo-Polish Lobby, Wiktor Jaroński, announced his appointment as acting prime minister and enacting of martial law on the whole territory of the Autonomy. At the same time, he wholeheartedly thanked the soldiers of the Russian army for their ‘efficient and bloodless elimination of elements hostile to Poland and the entire Empire’."

Unlike the rest of the building, this room was bright—too bright. The stark, nearly blinding white light always made him feel like a tiny ant being scrutinized under a researcher’s magnifying glass. Except this time, the one observing wasn’t a scientist, but a diminutive man with dusky skin, bottle-thick glasses, and lifeless, motionless shark-like eyes. He tried his best not to show fear—fear was the beginning of the end.\n’No, but I heard about it.’\n’Well, take a look,’ S. said casually, tossing a cream-colored envelope with one edge slit open. With slightly trembling fingers, he pulled out the first photo. It showed a man—no longer young, but still in excellent shape. Painted lips, shadowed eyelids, and a stylish dress paired with his delicate features might have deceived him into thinking this was a woman... if he didn’t already know who it was.\n’Is this from the Archangel?’\nS. simply nodded.\nHis throat went dry. Officially, they weren’t allowed to drink on duty, but in practice, no one paid attention. He took a deep swig from his flask.\n‘We have about twenty more like this,’ the captain spoke in his cold, detached voice. ‘Apparently, they call people like this’ — he paused for a moment – ‘femboys.’\nHe placed the photo down gently, as though it was a bomb.

Seated on the narrow and hard cot was Ignacy Mościcki. The weeks spent in the underground had not been kind to him—he had visibly lost weight, and his unshaven face framed eyes that held a strangely wild gleam.\n‘How are you feeling?’\n‘I've been better’, Mościcki muttered, lowering his gaze to the floor while simultaneously pressing his stomach. S. could not suppress a sadistic smirk.\n‘Without a doubt. How do you feel knowing that you’re going to be hanged? I’m sure that your big brain will go straight to the medical department of the University of Warsaw, where they’ll slice it up like a ham.’\nMościcki did not react; he only pressed his starving stomach more firmly.\n‘Ah, where are my manners’, S. said in a mockingly polite tone. ‘I’ve brought a gift’. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small piece of candy. The prisoner stared at him in silence for a moment before swiftly grabbing it and greedily stuffing it into his mouth.\n‘And that’s not the only gift’, the officer continued, pointing at the documents in his hand as Mościcki fervently chewed. ‘It would be a shame for such a brilliant mind to end up as a specimen for students.’\n‘My father and grandfather would weep in Heaven if I worked for you’, the professor swallowed loudly.\n‘Oh, I don’t doubt that... And in the meantime, you could be celebrating your life here, on Earth.

Earlier that day, he had undergone the standard torture sessions he had the misfortune of experiencing daily since his capture. Feeling the slow trickle of blood from a gash on his forehead, he tried to steady his heartbeat. Uncertainly, he touched his chest—it seemed that yet another rib was broken.\nThere was not much time left until the verdict was announced, but he had no idea how he would endure the days separating him from the longed-for end. To make matters worse, he had noticed that as the execution date approached, the intensity of the torture only seemed to increase. He had hoped that, with time, he would either grow accustomed to it… or that the Lord would finally take him. Both hopes had proven futile.\nSeveral days had passed since the visit of the mysterious guest—exactly how many, he couldn’t say. In the dim light filtering through the crooked peephole in the door, he was able, with some difficulty, to read the document that had been given to him. He was to become a scientific worker at a facility developing biological and chemical weapons somewhere in the provinces. Or at least, his brain was—because, as the document explicitly stated: 'Your brain would be surgically removed from your body and placed into a specially designed mechanical frame. Your body, meanwhile, would be executed in a public execution as planned. The traitor as you cannot beg for more.'\nIn other words, he would become a slave, one whom the world would believe to be dead.\nBut… he would be alive—or at least some part of him would. He would live and could continue working for Poland and the cause. He thought of the generations of Mościckis who had shed their blood for their homeland. He could almost feel their gaze burning into his back as he bent down to read the same words for the hundredth time.\nSomewhere in the distance, a heavy lock clanked, and he felt his heart leap into his throat.\n\nNo, no, NO!

And yet, he had the power to end it all. Not just end it—save his own skin! Well, maybe not literally his skin, as they wanted to harvest his brain and kill the body in public execution, keeping him as a pet in some facility.\nWith trembling fingers, he clutched the paper. He didn’t need to read it—he already knew every word by heart. He had been considering his options every moment they inflicted pain on him, though sometimes it became so overwhelming that he forgot his own name. Then he just wanted it to end.\nHe rubbed his nose anxiously. ‘A traitor as you cannot beg for more.’\n\n’I can, damn it!’, he thought fiercely. At that moment, through some insane effort, his mind managed to shut out the pain—though it would take only the slightest push to bring it crashing back down like a tsunami.\n\n‘Is this how it’s supposed to be now, eh?’ he raged internally. ‘Bands of mindless, old slaves working tirelessly to perfect the enslavement of their own children for the amusement of aristocrats? And then, when they are no longer needed, discarded like trash and replaced with younger? How many more innocent lives must be lost because of me? How many sons of this nation must I send to their deaths before I am released from this duty?’\nGritting his teeth against the pain, he slowly stood up. He sluggishly pulled down his trousers from his bruised buttocks and let a thin stream of urine soak into the documents before him.\nHe smiled to himself in his thoughts.\nHe knew that what he was about to do would end badly. That they would come and beat his old face into unconsciousness. But he couldn’t help himself."

Apocalypse.1.d:0 "Unsmoked cigarettes, scattered notes, shattered crockery—this was the scene that greeted the police two days ago when they entered the apartment of Professor Rudolf Weigl. The scientific director of the Anters project had not been seen since the beginning of the week, and concerned colleagues had already reported to the administration about the disturbing behaviours of the scholar. He had been spending long hours staring at the ant terrarium in his office, talking to himself when he thought no one was looking, and writing numerous notes in an unknown language.\nMany noticed that the condition of the already eccentric scientist significantly deteriorated after the cultivation of the second prototype of 'Big Brain'. These entities, despite lacking physical bodies, immediately began to communicate with each other. At first, they did so through schematic vibrations that set their tubes in motion; when this means of communication was taken away from them, they began emitting sounds at very high frequencies. After being isolated again, the entities developed the ability to communicate via radio waves, which deeply alarmed the project members, especially Weigl. When both tubes were locked in separate, appropriately prepared rooms, it seemed their exchange of information had finally ceased.\nHowever, a ordinary analysis of their activities was enough to prove this untrue; their method of communication remains unknown. During this period, many employees, including the professor, began to complain about a significant deterioration in health. Numerous migraines, nausea, and sleep problems affected at least twenty people. The director then decided that for safety reasons, only he should have direct contact with the objects, which led to the known deterioration of his mental state.\nDetectives examining Weigl's apartment found no signs of outside entry. Many documents were taken, and those that remained were written in an incomprehensible language. A large-scale secret search involving military gendarmerie is currently underway, but the chance of finding the professor diminishes with each passing hour. Scientists working on the project have noted that since Weigl's disappearance, the brains' activity has significantly increased. One even stated that the entities 'are as happy as children'."

Everyone questioned by the local Security Service unit described the experience as incredibly frightening.\nA local inspection revealed no concerning objects in the area, especially those capable of causing such large-scale phenomena. A troubling detail connecting all the nightmare sufferers is their employment at the nearby ‘St. Anna’ coal mine. In this mine, as in many others throughout Upper Silesia, a significant portion of the work is performed by Anters, whose new queen is equipped with a ‘Big Brain’ developed by Professor Weigl's research team. Since the implementation of these improvements a month and a half ago, the mine's productivity has increased significantly, the drones work more cohesively, and even the workers had no complaints.\nThat was until today.\nThe queen's examination by Weigl's team found no malfunctions. The incident has been classified as a case of mass hysteria caused by internal and international tensions.\nThe introduction of the great brains is one of the government's flagship projects, aimed at rapidly restoring the Polish economy. News of the unpleasant experiences faced by those working with the Anters could negatively affect public opinion and contribute to unwanted behaviours. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that information about this incident does not reach the public."

The heir to the largest fortune in the Empire, he led an idyllic life like many others of his background until the age of eighteen. At the outbreak of the Great War, Felix was old enough to be drafted, but being the only son allowed him to avoid conscription—a fate that befell millions of his peers. Wanting to support his homeland in its time of need, he became an organizer of hospitals on his family's estates, raised funds for soldiers fighting, and spoke aggressively in parliament about traitors and defeatists.\n\nAfter the conflict ended, twenty-four-year-old Felix went to Great Britain to study at the University of Oxford. This did not diminish his penchant for entertainment—the young aristocrat became known to the local population as a brawler and drunkard, but also as the life of the party. Armed with a university degree, he returned in 1914 and once again shone in the salons of St. Petersburg. His eccentric lifestyle caught the attention of a princess of imperial blood, Irina.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the marriage had a completely unexpected effect on Felix. Overnight, he transformed from a carefree and irresponsible youth into a true prince. Rumours of his excesses completely disappeared, and his lifestyle became decidedly more tranquil. The birth of their daughter was the crowning achievement of this transformation. Direct access to the Tsar’s ear, family connections, and seemingly endless wealth opened doors to a rapid political career for the young Yusupov, which he eagerly seized while also increasing his riches.\n\nA benefactor to hundreds of millions, biggest shareholder of Tesla Electricworks, admired by women, Felix became a serious candidate for the position of prime minister. Fearing his relative's power, the new Tsar, Michael II, decided to limit his influence. Invitations to balls became less frequent, honours came more rarely, until in 1930 the ruler decided— the prince would become new Namiestnik of Poland.\n\nFor the ambitious Yusupov, this decision was like a sentence. Poland—an unstable fief of the empire—was to become his ultimate failure. An impossible task, a blow from which he would not recover... But he's the one with the money.\n\nAnd he knows how to spend it well."

High costs, outdated or non-existent infrastructure, and declining resource prices create a situation where, without thorough reform, there is a serious risk of collapse and a dependence on foreign sources for such essential materials as coal and steel.\n\nIn 1920, while working on a revolutionary vaccine for epidemic typhus, Polish biologist Rudolf Weigl discovered methods to facilitate the genetic modification of insects. Initially, he conducted his research on lice but quickly shifted focus to ants, making them achieve sizes never seen in nature. His ideas caught the interest of the Ministry of Industry, which granted him substantial funding.\n\nNow, after more than a decade of work with the government team of mining experts led by engineer Marian Szydłowski, the project appears to be on the final stretch toward creating a fully functional prototype. This breakthrough could not only save the Polish industry from the brink but elevate it to previously unimaginable heights.\n\n[get_WAE_Desc]\n\n§CCURRENT ANT BONUSES§!\n[get_WAE_resources_factor]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
