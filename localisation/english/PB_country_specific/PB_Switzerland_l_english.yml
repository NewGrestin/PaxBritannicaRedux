  PB_SWI_Neutrality: "Necessitive Neutrality"
  PB_SWI_Neutrality_desc: "While formally tied by no treaties nor obligations to do so, the Confederacy has remained geopolitically neutral for most of its modern History. While we may have the pretence of justifying our stance in the name of peace and concord among all Europeans, the reality behind such posture is far more rough but cannot be overlooked for a nation of our size and rank. \n\nStrategically positioned between three titans whose military strength has yet to be questioned, the Confederacy have ensured none of those giants could ever pose a threat to its territorial unity. Furthermore, Switzerland's very nature makes it virtually impossible to envision expansion without unbalancing the cantonal whole. \n\nSurviving through the Great War and being bolstered afterward thanks to German trade and the World Databank's benefits, this neutral posturing we endorsed until now might very much come to an end should the resurging French militarism ever pose a threat to our sovereignty."

  PB_SWI_bund_tensions_low: "Bund Tensions:§G Low§!"
  PB_SWI_bund_tensions_low_desc: "Because of the nature of the confederation, centralised policies on anything is basically nigh impossible when it’s a controversial subject. One of those infamous subjects is the Swiss constitution, or rather the lack of a constitution. All important decisions are still made the same way as they were in the 1700s; by the Federal Diet in Zürich. The religions lines drew themselves during the protestant reformation still dominate the country’s politics and although the protestants are technically in the majority, cantons of either religion are increasingly deciding to take a third side outside of old religious debacles, straining the power of the Diet even more. And in this era of radicalisation who knows if the question might be solved violently or peacefully."

  PB_SWI_bund_tensions_moderate: "Bund Tensions:§B Moderate§!"

  PB_SWI_habsburg_treaty: "Habsburg Treaty"
  PB_SWI_habsburg_treaty_desc: "Although de facto independent from the Holy Roman Empire since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Swiss confederation and its associates still had to sign, a somewhat humiliating, treaty with the United Kingdoms of Germany in 1870 when this formed. As the new German state had desires of uniting all Germans, including those in Switzerland. However this would have certainly caused international outrage, and instead the two states signed a treaty stating that they would be neutral towards each other and not aid each other's enemies in the event of war. This came with economic agreements heavily favouring the German Kingdoms. This treaty still stands but is increasingly becoming a burden on the Swiss economy and straining relations between the two nations as both have very separate ideas of what a confederation should be in the modern age."

  PB_SWI_waning_associates: "Waning Associates"
  PB_SWI_waning_associates_desc: "The associates of the Swiss Confederacy date all the way back to the middle ages, and are a series of Cantons on the fringes of the confederacy that technically aren’t part of the confederacy. Their citizens do have Swiss citizenship, and the Swiss army defends them, but they could theoretically disband the association treaty and become fully independent cantons and join other nations, like Neuchatel and Jura. This divide between these loosely affiliated cantons and the federal diet may not seem big on a cultural level, but economically the cantons have basically free reign and do not have to adhere to decisions of the Federal Diet if they don't wish to. The cantons in the confederacy are currently divided whether these associates should be able to properly join the confederacy or not."

  PB_SWI_databank_world: "The World Databank"
  PB_SWI_databank_world_desc: "On the verge of Mont Blanc lies the silicon hearth of the Confederacy. Within shimmering towers, behind the steel appendix of giant cooling cores and neverending mazes of circuits and wires, the World Databank computes the civilised world's lifeblood. Money flows through the building's components, intangible yet still as much valuable as it would in the form of banknotes. \n\nAs first conceived as a way to hasten monetary circulation throughout Central Europe, the World Databank's has greatly benefited from the development of fractional-reserve banking throughout the last decades — gaining the ability to not only hold reserves, but create it altogether. This newfound prerogative has only made the institution even more powerful, and while its capacities are officially restrained by international agreements, the opaqueness of its functioning can allow for a whole new level of secrecy and fraudulent scheme. \n\nThis, however, is only the known part of what's truly hidden down there. Further below, gigantic branching of camouflaged networks pulse at the frantic rhythm of billions of operations. As the true motives behind this calculation frenzy remain unknown to most, one thing is certain for sure: \n\nSomething huge is being assembled here."
