The nation of New Walden is primarily founded on the tenets of the philosopher Henry David Thoreau and peak Yeoman principles - holding great value to the Natural Order of the world and the true Frontier Spirit. The nation founded by numerous naturalists and socialists who were angered by the Second Renaissance, and the frequent and numerable transgressions against the natural world and the people living in it. Seeking refuge and safety in the American West in hopes of establishing a model colony and an anarchist society initially in the region of Columbia, and later spread their Anarchist zeal towards the entire North American Continent. \n\nThe several socialists and naturalists would valiantly uphold the ideals of Trancendentalism, fully believing that they are the final bastion and protectors of the Mother Earth itself, though it should absolutely be noted that while the is the beacon of the community it is isn't the only one. The nation also holds up several socialists principles and populism, being very much one of the few bastions of the people in the Wild West and Northwest Pacific. \n\n Though this nation would show a lot of promise, it would still hold quite a few problems. Alongside the Sons of Liberty attempting to show resistance against the Trancendentalist Government, it would also have to defend itself from constant raids from its surrounding nations hoping to claim the nearby Communes and Settlements. Waldenia would find itself in a rather difficult position to defend itself, due to its stuggle in producing military equipment. New Walden would be caught on the backleg if it were to find itself in either a defensive or offensive war.\n\n Despite these troubles, New Walden maintains its status as an democracy with anarchist principles, and holds their free principles up as a stalwart beacon - never to be destroyed.  \n\n §GHarmony in Diversity, Freedom in Nature§! \n\n §YSpecial thanks to§!:Sprinkleskid, Tapir, Gabgame, Nohan, Two Watt, Grixly, and all others in the Pax team who provided the means to create this submod\n\n\n"

    PB_NWA_Trancendentalist_Vanguard_desc:0 "To nobodys surprise, having a nation mostly focused on the aspects of Socialism, Free Art, Poetry, Peace, and Nature doesn't exactly provide much in the department of defending itself. While, we did of course win our independence against the American Confederation(all be it with much assistance from Freedonian, Meizhou, Mormon, and Tacoman independence fronts), under great appreciations to our Guerilla fighters and People's Militias. We really don't have much in the name of defense. \nOur nation founded on the principles of peace and harmony of nature, under the teachings of the great philospher of Henry David Thoreau, though our neighbors would most definitely like to see the extinction of humble Waldenia. Though the Green shirts under People's Defender Hargraves may be the closest thing we have to a defense force and are certainly doing their best, if we are to maintain our way of life we most definitely need to provide our army the proper attention they deserve."

PB_NWA_Frontier_Democracy:0 "Frontier Democracy"
    PB_NWA_Frontier_Democracy_desc:0 "The cause of the Libertalian Rebellions being the failure of the Seattle War, New Walden wasn't so keen to be the first nation to jump ship. When Freedonia and Tabernacle took up arms against the American Confederation, the lands now known as Waldenia remained loyal, but once Leonard Wood declared Martial Law and broke the foundations of Democracy - our nation fatefully declared allegiance to our Democratic-Republican Roots. \nNew Walden may not be a shining example for its practices, but it very much and always will have allegiance towards this freedom, and will not give it up without a fight."

PB_NWA_Ghosts_TAC:0 "Ghosts of New Virginia"
    PB_NWA_Ghosts_TAC_desc:0 "While we may have won our independence against the American Confederation, we are under not quite so free to develop our nation under Thoreau's Ideals. \nThere are Minutemen, and Continental Army resistance fighters still lodged towards the New Virginian Border - acting as so called "freedom fighters" in the name of the hypocritical traitors of Liberty, and while our nation's defenders may actively be attempting to drive them from our lands, they will continue to be a sizeable thorn in our side until they are dealt with."

PB_NWA_Renaissance_Rejection:0 "Rejection of the Renaissance"
    PB_NWA_Renaissance_Rejection_desc:0 "If the Industrial Revolution brought forth a borderline eradication of Yeoman Principles in the world, a means for capitalist exploitation on the world stage, and vast destruction of the natural world in the name of "progress", then the Industrial Renaissance's desruction brought forth the complete destruction and devestation on an even more leviathan of scales. It is the very opponent of our way of life, and while the other Industrial nations of the world may damn themselves and their workers - it is here in our eden where nature may be sanctified forever. \n\nWhile the nation of New Walden at the moment practices a more tame version of Trancendentalism - despite being under the guises of Anarchism, the rejection of Industrialisation and the Industrial Renaissance is integral to the aspects and ideals of the nation.\nThough under your undertaking, you may either §Gfurther tame it and bring about a more comfortable life for the people of North America§! or §Rbring forth a means to further the flame of Trancendentalism beyond the borders of the West§!"

PB_NWA_Home_Of_Mother_Anarchy_desc:0 "Spurred on by the teachings of American transcendentalist Henry David Thorea, New Walden is a state without a state. In laymen terms it houses no government of any kind save for the few community councils littered throughout the nation’s landscape. New Walden has no military, no economy, it has nothing. New Walden is a green anarchistic paradise, one that comes with all the positives and negatives such a sociopolitical theory brings."

For now, residents of the Communes remain steadfast in their commitment to the principles that have defined their way of life, eager to navigate this period of transition with the same cooperative spirit that has characterized their community - Only one question remains. \n\nWho will succeed him."

And would most advantly support the ideas known as "Civil Disobedience." Such principles are of the upmost standing in our Eden's society. Though the people of New Walden are young, and shapable to the influences around them - allowing for the development of a rainbow political spectrum in Waldenia. If any action were to be taken against the principles of Thoreau - be it Civil Disbedience or Trancendentalism, the populace will certainly not take kindly to it. However, as a result of the so called Flame of Trancendentalism, you may be able to transform the people's will into a powerful tool."

Things like Japanese Cuisine, Customs, Poetry, and Arts have taken off rather well among the New Walden Populace. A few locations in various settlements were dedicated towards the worship of Shintoism and Buddhism, the former recieving minor criticism due to the reverance of the former Emperor being seen as somewhat taboo amongst the New Walden Republican populace, though such worries were eventually put away. Many members of the New Walden Episcopal Church Communites decided to assist the Shinto communities - in reminder to their own beliefs and situationship with the Anglican Church. \nDespite, whatever troubles there may have been previously, the Nissei Culture appears to remain in having an impact amongst the Waldenian Populace."

The future of New Walden is secure... in their hands now. But is it really my future to guide anymore? The words “retirement” had been creeping into his thoughts more frequently in recent months, like a shadow at the edge of a sunset.\nThe thought of returning to his old life as a biologist—immersed in the untamed rhythms of nature—was seductive. The world of science feels so much more tangible. Back among the pines, the streams, the forests. A place where the complexities of life don’t require speeches, just understanding. He remembers the field journals, the hours spent observing ecosystems, cataloging species, pondering the infinite mystery of life that he’d once loved so much. The rhythm of it, the clarity of purpose, the absence of bureaucracy. I’ve done my part. They will carry it forward. It’s time for new voices. The nation, vibrant and growing, now has its own heartbeat. It no longer needs a biologist-turned-President to guide it through troubled waters. And maybe that’s the most selfless thing I could do—step aside for the next generation.\nI’ve done my part. They will carry it forward. It’s time for new voices.

And maybe that’s the most selfless thing I could do—step aside for the next generation.\n The audience's applause still rang out in his mind from his speech, Richard Clarke Cabot stands alone for a moment, gazing out over the empty chamber. I’ll have to make my choice soon. But whatever I do, I know thisthe Heart of New Walden will always beat on, be it in the halls of governance or in the quiet rustling of leaves in the woods."

However, in recent days the area would find a notable brand of Coffee to be quite a trademark amongst the Northwest Pacific nations. \n\nFollowing New Walden’s successful uprising against the American Confederation, the young nation would begin to sow ties and friendship with the Socialist Nations to the South, such as California, Yucatan, Rio Grande, and whatnot. \nAiming to open new markets, and also potentially a new friend to the Northwest. California would send shipments of Coffee to the Northwest as a form of gift and show of friendship. Surprisingly though, the once gift, would seemingly explode and take off incredibly successfully over the fledgling states to the North. Several customers and businesses having taken to open new markets, one taking off rather successfully is a brand known as "Pequod Coffeehouse Cooperative". Being known for their branding of a Siren in respect to the Northwest’s Maritime Heritage. The brand has come to be known all over the Northwestern Territories. Even having a small chain in Portland in the American Confederation. Many have suggested and proposed that they attempt to open branches in the United Commonwealth, the co-op has said that such plans are far in the future."
