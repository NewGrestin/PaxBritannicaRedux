PB_SPR_Extreme_Polarisation:0 "Extreme Political Polarisation"
PB_SPR_Extreme_Polarisation_desc:0 "Shamed by our war against the British, broken by the infamous Iberian campaign and beaten down by the loss of its colonial empire, Spain has lost any optimism in the future. The days are bleak and the people remain grim, as our prospect for prosperity grows slimmer every month. These conditions have been an unfortunate breeding ground for radicals, as the jacobins of the PPIJ and the nationalists of the FE grow with every election, winning a large share of the votes each time as people lose their patience with the established parties. The radicalisation of the population has even lead to violence, targetting anyone who stands in the way of progress or tradition, depending on what kind of radical we're talking about. Despite this climate of political polarisation, the chances of the republicans aren't completely gone and the next election in '36 could give the republicans the swift boost they need to preserve the republic for as long as time may last."
PB_SPR_Military_Conspiracy:0 "The Military Conspiracy"
PB_SPR_Military_Conspiracy_desc:0 "When the king was ousted out of Spain after the Great War, the Republic was proclaimed. The army, however, didn't change with this monumental event in Spanish history, as many of the old royal army kept their place in the republican army. While this would have already been a dangerous cocktail for any new republic to deal with, the Spanish Republic clearly outdid its republican brothers in Europe by letting the army rot, lowering expenses every single year and leaving it with ancient equipment. Thus, the army has turned against the republic. Supposedly. \n\nWhile real evidence of a conspiracy is non-existent currently, we cannot deny the possible existence of such a plan. The army has already been divided in a million different interest groups, with the monarchists and africanists being the largests of the groups. Young, ambitious men and older, experienced gentlemen have made their troops loyal to them first, putting the republic in a dangerous position. We can't last another storm if we remain ignorant of this conspiracy."
PB_SPR_War_Reps:0 "Promise of War Reparations"
PB_SPR_War_Reps_desc:0 "The defeat of the Spanish Kingdom at the hands of the British left us at the mercy of the rotten bastards in Westminster. The eventual deal wasn't as bad as he could have been, but the war reparations were an exception. The absurd amount of pesetas that we were forced to pay in the direct years after the war crippled the economy. Bad policies and corrupt politicians wouldn't improve the matter, leading to some sympathy from the UK and more leniency on the reparations. Still, these reparations remain huge sums and continue to hinder our government."

spain.1.t:0 "The Mary Coup Chaos"
spain.1.d:0 "Not too long ago, Emilio Mola with support of the army and the right-wing of Spain, has been able to stage a violent coup against the anti-catholic republican government. The republican government was founded in 1911, one year before the official signing of the treaty of A Coruña, founded on the ruins of Madrid after the brutal civil war between Alfonso loyalists and republican forces. However, the years after the treaty were quite unstable with rebellion after rebellion. While stability has always been rare for Spain, the Republicans never bothered to fix the instability and created enemies on all fronts.\n\n The 1931 elections would prove to be the last straw, as democratic traditions grinded to a halt with the opposition and coalition not being able to work with the rising Falange party. On the 29th of October, 1932, after a proposal to ban the Falangist party, the party members ran out of parliament, forcing snap elections upon Spain. Those snap elections would never come. With support of the army and the CEDA party, the Falange was able to coup the republican government on the 18th of December. The death of Sanjurjo on the 30th of December forced Emilio Mola to become the next head of state. However, republican forces, while broken, are not defeaten and are organizing themselves on the borders of the Spanish state. Can Mola crush this government and start a new age for Spain?"
spain.1.a:0 "Probally not..."
spain.2.t:0 "Spanish Violation of the A Coruña Treaty"
spain.2.d:0 "Under the 7th demand of the A Coruña Treaty, the treaty that ended the Great War between the British and the Spanish kingdoms, Spain is not allowed to field an army that has more than 100 000 men working in it. Recently, however, British spies and ambassadors have notified us about the Spanish army having crossed that 100 000 limit, violating the promises made in the treaty of A Coruña. Thus, strong voices have made it clear that Britain is forced to intervene if it wants to maintain its power across Europe and especially in the Mediterranean. Such an ultimatum would most likely bring Spain back into the fold."
spain.2.a:0 "Send the ultimatum!"
spain.2.b:0 "Let's turn a blind eye..."
spain.3.t:0 "British Ultimatum"
spain.3.d:0 "Despite our best bet, Britain has finally send an ultimatum regarding our military size violating the despised treaty of A Coruña. Our violation is, if we have to believe the British, a clear sign of agression towards the old Entente and the European status quo and we should swiftly seize our expansion. If we do not adhere to the ultimatum or do not reply in 10 days, Britain will be forced to use violence against the Spanish state and its army and depose the military government in favor of a more 'pro-British' regime. The bottom of the ultimatum is signed by the British minister of foreign affaires."
spain.3.b:0 "Send a simple, yet firm, \"No\""
spain.3.a:0 "We cannot fight the British yet"
spain.4.t:0 "Britain turns a Blind Eye"
spain.4.d:0 "Even if we violated the 7th article of the treaty of A Coruña, Britain has yet to send us an ultimatum regarding our expansive endeavour. While some were worried about a British mobilization act, relative inactivity from London has confirmed this to not be the case. Whatever it may be, Britain has not bothered to send us an ultimatum or declare war and we can thus only assume that they've turned a blind eye for our violation."
spain.4.a:0 "Gracias"
spain.5.t:0 "Spain rejected our Ultimatum"
spain.5.d:0 "After a tense, several days, words from Madrid have reached London. Well, technically it was only one word: \n\n \"No" \n\nSpain has clearly not listened to our warnings of violence and we should now make up our mind on the matter of intervening in Spain or allowing the state to continue its expansive behaviour."
spain.5.a:0 "Tommy, get your gun!"
spain.5.b:0 "Spain is not a concern for our empire"
spain.6.t:0 "Spain accepted our Ultimatum"
spain.6.d:0 "Our recent ultimatum to the Spanish military has been a stagering success, as Spain has accepted our demands regarding their military expansion."
spain.6.a:0 "Another victory for the Empire"
spain.7.t:0 "Republicans Reorganized"
spain.7.d:0 "Despite our best effort of crushing the Republican forces, a substantial amount of them have been able to reorganize in traditionally republican strongholds in Spain. Thus, with their forces reorganized, they've declared a campaign against the, in their eyes, illegitimate government of Spain. Mola has already adressed Madrid on the issue during a broadcast this monday, pressing the issue to be one of national scale. His broadcast, while not particularly inspiring, had a great morale effect on our troops, which patiently await orders from the Madrid high command."
spain.7.a:0 "No Pasaran!"
spain.7.b:0 "United against jacobinism, we crusaders fight!"
spain.8.t:0 "The Death of the Republic"
spain.8.d:0 "The recent few months Spain had experienced were rough, as outlaws and other republican sympathisers terrorised Spain in their campaign of revenge. However, the Spanish nationalist army was able to corner the reorganizing Republican forces today, leading to a crushing defeat for the Republican army and most of the leadership being killed in combat. With the Republican menace gone, Spain is open to reform and go down a path towards its deserved glory as an empire, comparable to the empire of Charles."
spain.8.a:0 "Una, Grande y Libre!"
SPR_change_to_SPN_tooltip:0 "§YSwitches tag to the Spanish Republic§!"
spain.10.t:0 "End of the Guerilla Campaign"
spain.10.d:0 "With the start of the new Civil War, the Republican army has stopped its guerilla campaign against the poor working citizens and the factories that were under Mola's control."
spain.10.a:0 "Great"
spain.11.t:0 "Victory of the Civil War"
spain.11.d:0 "As the black boots of the Spanish military walk down upon the streets of Madrid and Barcelona, the nationalist government rejoices in victory, as the enemy of the state has been vanquished. With the last military victory of this civil war, Spain has secured its future under the national movement and shall rise to great power status under its new government. However, even if celebration happens, the members of the movement are already scheming against their opponents and it won't take long before Spain will divide once more."
spain.11.a:0 "Victory for now"
spain.12.t:0 "The Emergency Tax"
spain.12.d:0 "Recently, Mola adressed the Spanish nation on the problems it faced at this very moment. Stating that the Republican threat is one to be taken serious, Mola quickly turned the subject towards military tax. While an unpopular move, Mola sees the tax as a temporary and necessary act for Spain, argueing that any military support in their conflict against the republicans could help."
spain.12.a:0 "It's just temporary guys!"
spain.13.t:0 "The CNT-FAI"
spain.13.d:0 "The CNT-FAI unions have been powerfull political entities in Spain since the end of the monarchy after the Great War. They often have been disrupting the government through both strikes and revolutions and their anarchist ideology makes them a primary enemy of our authoritarian and nationalist ambitions. A meeting with the collective leadership of the CNT-FAI has been organized and we'll have to decide our policy on the future of this part of our opposition."
spain.13.a:0 "Mutual friendship with the unions could come handy..."
spain.13.b:0 "They'll have to fear us"
spain.14.t:0 "Farmers united against Tax"
spain.14.d:0 "The recent emergency tax of the military junta has been subject of heated debate for several weeks now and tension has finally hit a boiling point, as angered farmers have united in guerilla groups against the government tax. While possibly a noble cause in the eyes of some, the groups quickly have turned into ordinary bandits, stealing from the rich and poor for their own benefit and, worst of all, still not paying their taxes. The government has to make it loud and clear to these groups of so-called heroes that they're not welcome."
spain.14.a:0 "Farmers are no threat to any government!"
spain.15.t:0 "Fall of the Popular Front"
spain.15.d:0 "Recent political infighting among the ideological members of the popular front opened up an opportunity for the military junta to eliminate the united opposition entiretly. Manuel Azaña's representation of the popular front became a point of disagreement between the syndicalist-jacobin branches of the front and the liberal branches of the front, with both branches threatening to end the coalition. Due to our extensive espionage inside the coalition and several unethical political methods, we've been able to exploit the situation to the fullest: Today, during one of the most heated discussions yet, the radical left of the party ended the coalition, leaving the popular front and splitting into several parties, the Partido Sindicalista of Ángel Pestaña currently being the largest of the splinters. As response, Niceto's liberal branch followed, forming the Partido Republicana Progresista. Manuel Azaña and the remnants of the popular front now remain as the Izquierda Republicana, ending the united opposition against the Mola regime."
spain.15.a:0 "And there ends our largest opponent."
SPR_CUR_FIRST:0 "§YThe current economy is to be adressed first§!"
spain.16.t:0 "Autoridad Española de Reconstrucción"
spain.16.d:0 "In his latest talk with the nation, [SPR.GetLeader] announced the formation of a new reconstruction authority situated in Madrid, which will bear the task of repairing the damage done by the republican militias across Spain and funding the conversion of the economy into a new, civilian one, as to return prosperity to Spain. His plans of the new reconstruction authority have already been given the green light by the high command and [SPR.GetLeader] has already appointed Alfonso Peña Boeuf as the leading figure of the authority. Having studied at the school of engineering of roads, canals and ports, Alfonso is considered an infrastructural genius by many of his peers and [SPR.GetLeader] has big plans for the balding engineer."
spain.16.a:0 "A great project is coming!"
spain.17.t:0 "The Status of Spanich Economics"
spain.17.d:0 "With the establishment of the reconstruction authority, the first issue to adress is the militarized economy. Mola and the rest of the military junta had mobilized the Spanish economy after the Mary coup, as fears of civil war were rather real in Spain. This, however, has damaged our economy rather badly, leaving us with a mobilized economy, but without a decent civilian basis for it. Basic products like civilian clothing, vehicles and even some parts of the food sector were completely claimed by the Spanish army in the case of combat. However, with the civil unrest coming to a halt, Spain is forced to demobilize its economy if it wants to start its economic recovery."
spain.17.a:0 "We will do what needs to be done"
spain.18.t:0 "Preparing the First National Movement Congress"
spain.18.d:0 "With the recent stabilization of Spain, the National Movement coalition has finally been able to start preparations for their first national congress next year. The parties inside the national movement will all attend the national congress, as the congress will decide the fate of Spain, choosing a coalition party to rule Spain. Both the falangists of the FET y de la JONS, as the monarchist bloc of the carlists have been heavily involved in the preparations of the congress, with the alfonsists being too divided on the issue and the CEDA being barred from the preparations entirely, due to their earlier association with the Spanish republic and its parliament. The military has also agreed upon following the choices set by the congress, but Mola himself seems to be less willing in giving up his leadership."
spain.18.a:0 "Let's prepare ourselves!"
spain.19.t:0 "The death of Mola"
spain.19.d:0 "The leader of the Spanish military junta, Emilio Mola, has been confirmed dead this morning. The military commander, known as el director, strolled across the city of Madrid with his group of military bodyguards, when he became a part of an incidental carcrash. Mola died on the spot and the man responsible for the leader's death has been sentenced to death, even after he insisted that it was just an accident. In the wake of his death, the young Francisco Franco, veteran of the 1901 Rif conflict, was put in charge of the provisional government."
spain.19.a:0 "May Mola rest in peace"
spain.20.t:0 "New Geography Books"
spain.20.d:0 "With the recent decision to renew the education curriculum of Spain into a more government friendly form, the details have finally become a big part of the debate. The first subject to adress is geography, with the falangist and carlist parties pressing the issue of Pan-Iberianism and the territory of Gibraltar. They've favored changing the geography textbooks, as to show all Spanish claims, including Portugal and its colonies, Gibraltar, Andorra and even some parts of French Catalonia. While radical, many inside the movement seem to not have a problem with changing the textbooks in such a way."
spain.20.a:0 "Include all Spanish Claims!"
spain.20.b:0 "Only include Gibraltar"
spain.20.c:0 "Let's not fool ourselves with claims"
spain.21.t:0 "New History Books"
spain.21.d:0 "The next subject to tackle in the curriculum reformation is the history textbooks, a important subject for most right-wing parties in the movement. The Falangist Party, Alfonsists and Carlists have already butted heads on the issue, as not one party can decide what to highlight in the textbooks. The falangists have made it their point to highlight Spanish cultural supremacy and its most important battles against barbarism. The carlists, on the other hand, have voiced their opinions in favour of portraying the carlists monarchs as best as possible and highlighting catholic imperialism. As last, the alfonsist parties have mostly been in favor of portraying the most recent years of the monarchy in a better light compared to the old republican textbooks."
spain.21.a:0 "Highlight the Carlist monarchs and their catholic supremacy"
spain.21.b:0 "Highlight the cultural success of Spanish imperialism"
spain.21.c:0 "Highlight the Alfonso monarchy and its Africanism"
spain.22.t:0 "New Economics Books"
spain.22.d:0 "Last, but definetely not least, is the subject of economy. While economy seem to be of little controversy, it was one of the only subjects that almost caused a brawl today between the Falange and the Carlist Party. While the Falange proposed the promotion of national syndicalist economics and its benefits, the carlists denounced the falangists as modernists and promoted the idea of pre-enlightenment economics. The Carlist denouncement of national syndicalism quickly led to several Falangist party members stepping towards the carlist side of parliament, but they were quickly detained by the parliament soldiers, keeping tension at a minimum. It's rather clear that both of these parties will not like any decision we will make."
spain.22.a:0 "National-Syndicalist Economics"
spain.22.b:0 "Pre-Enlightenment Economics"
spain.22.c:0 "Free Market Economics"
SPR_EDUCATION_CHAIN:0 "§GAn event chain will allow us to decide our new education curriculum and what to teach the next politically active generation of Spain.§!"
spain.23.t:0 "Deal with the Steel Barons"
spain.23.d:0 "The recent expansion of the steel industry in Aragon has clearly had its benefits for both the government and a small group of factory owners, known as the steel barons. These steel barons have, however, become a threat to our national economy, acting increasingly independent from the other industries of Spain and spoiling themselves with unimaginable riches. The government has thus been assembled to discuss this situation. The Falangist Party of Primo de Rivera has made it clear that the steel barons are a threat to the future of Spain and, with imperialist support, has proposed the nationalization of the steel industry in their crusade against capitalism. The monarchists parties, seeing the threat that the Falange poses, have united in their opinion, proposing private investments in the factories for both government and personal benefit. At last, the CEDA, being generally a fan of the free market, has made it clear that the government could subsidize the factories, as to improve the state treasury and the general welfare of the people of Aragon. The debate has clearly started to become heated, as both the Falange and the CEDA are to eachothers throats. How should we solve this problem?"
spain.23.a:0 "Follow the CEDA method of subsidizing"
spain.23.b:0 "Private monarchist investments would work better"
spain.23.c:0 "Nationalize the factories, as the falangists told us"
spain.24.t:0 "Unemployment Issue Returns"
spain.24.d:0 "Before the Mary Coup, Spain was camping with a huge unemployment issue, as many veterans of the Great War were unable to work in the factories. The later economic recession under the Spanish Republic would also increase the amount of unemployed people and would swiftly paralyze the Spanish economy, as almost 20% of Spanish working men did not have a job. With the Mary Coup and the extensive army expansion, these unemployed were finally able to work. However, the recent economic conversion has, once again, made these people unemployed and many fear that the situation could spiral out of the governments control. Thus, it's critical that we fix the unemployment issue."
spain.24.a:0 "We're going to fix it!"
spain.25.t:0 "Promotion of the Sherry Region"
spain.25.d:0 "Due to increased governmental effort to promote the important Sherry region, Spain has begun to experience an influx of British, French, German, Russian, Italian and Dutch tourists, all coming to Spain to experience the tasty Sherry wine. Our promotion has clearly helped develop the lower regions of Spain like Andalusia and Sevilla and has created a tourist industry comparable to the beaches of the Costa Brava in Catalonia."
spain.25.a:0 "Life is great in Andalusia"
spain.26.t:0 "New Entertainment"
spain.26.d:0 "With the return to a civilian economy, the demand for entertainment has once again skyrocketed in Spain. The government has taken a liking to the new civilian economy and has clearly seen the potential for influencing the market. Thus, a debate between the parties of the national movement has started regarding the new purpose of entertainment. Every party seem to support the idea of propagating their values through media, with the falangists and CEDA being the biggest supporters of it."
spain.26.a:0 "Support the values of military cooperation through the media"
spain.26.b:0 "Romanticize the medieval era"
spain.26.c:0 "Fantasize about the old days before the republic, during the war"
spain.26.e:0 "Idealize family and christianity under the republic"
spain.27.t:0 "Issue of Our Flag"
spain.27.d:0 "The recent falangist victory has left Spain with Primo de Rivera as the absolute ruler and the Falangist Party as the only legal party. Thus, the issue of the party's flag has been brought up. The main question asked by party officials, is if the party is Spain or Spain is the party. Can the party flag truely represent Spain and its identity, or will the normal flag that has flown across Spain for centuries do?"
spain.27.a:0 "Keep the normal flag"
spain.27.b:0 "Adopt the party flag"
spain.28.t:0 "First National Movement Congress - Day 1"
spain.28.d:0 "The day Spain has been waiting on has finally come. Madrid celebrates the first national movement congress, as thousands of Spanish men and wwomen dance in the streets, hoping for a better future. The First National Movement Congress started with a bang, as the thousands of invited guests enjoyed a display of various Spanish traditions: Flamenco, waltzing on patriotic jota music and a by Francisco Franco organized military march accompanied by the national anthem. After the joyfull music, Francisco Franco gave a small speech on the importance of securing Spain's future on the worldstage, voicing his support for no party. Thunderous applause followed the end of his speech. Several other partyleaders, including Primo de Rivera and Fal Conde would also speech, hoping to gain more support for their parties. With the end of Fal Conde's speech, the first day of the congress came to an end."
spain.28.a:0 "A day filled with joy and hope!"
spain.29.t:0 "First National Movement Congress - Day 2"
spain.29.d:0 "As the sun rises on Spain, the second day of the Congress begins. This day is dominated by the final debate and the party election, as all 4 parties hope to win the vote today. The congress in Madrid was, once again, opened by Field Marshall Francisco Franco. The famous military leader explained the voting process of today to the many invited guests and reinforced his last message about the future of Spain. Another applause for Francisco Franco and the debates could officially begin. It was rather intense, as many members harshly critized the other parties, with falangist supporter Manuel Hedilla accusing the CEDA membership of republican sympathies. Many yelled, some cried, and after three hours of drama the debates ended with the last debate against FE leader De Rivera and Carlist leader Fal Conde. The debate was an intense back-and-forth between the two leaders, portraying the other parties as bad choices while promoting their own parties. In a last minute ditch effort, De Rivera accused Fal Conde of adultery, something that shocked the entire congress. Silence reigned for 10 seconds till screaming filled the air and punches were thrown. The disaster of the last debate has thus forced the final vote to tomorrow."
spain.29.a:0 "That could have gone better, I guess"
spain.30.t:0 "First National Movement Congress - Day 3"
spain.30.d:0 "After the disaster that was the second day of the congress, Madrid is eerily quiet this morning, as many men and women have gone to work, not caring to celebrate this unofficial last day of the congress. Nevertheless, the congress continues as the final vote can finally be held. Under the close eye of Francisco Franco, who had only recently heard about the catastrophe caused by De Rivera, the members of all parties have gathered today in the Palacio de la Cortes. General Francisco Franco, trying to keep the peace, has decided to not open this day with a speech and instead has promptly authorized the process of the final vote. As the votes are gathered and counted, the sphere becomes increasingly hostile. Deathstares become common, as the big parties that caused the mishap yesterday still remember the controversial claim of De Rivera. Finally, the votes are counted. Francisco Franco, temporary head of the Spanish government, hears the results."
spain.30.a:0 "And the winner is...."
SPR_FINAL_VICTORY:0 "§YThis final vote will choose the party that will lead Spain for at least 5 years. The fate of Spain will however not only be decided by this vote, but many other events later down the line.§! \n\n§RIf no party has a clear majority of the votes, Spain will have a bad time§!"
spain.31.t:0 "The Falange Española!"
spain.31.d:0 "As the victory is announced by field marshall Francisco Franco, celebration fills the palace of the former Spanish republic, as the falangists and their leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera bless their victory in the final vote. On the other side of the room, the carlists have quietly begun to leave the building after their unofficial leader Manuel Fal Conde stormed the building with his wife. The CEDA has also been rather quiet, while the Alfonsists loudly complain about the results. However, their complains are drowned out by the screams of victory, as the falangist party is now the ruling party of the Spanish state and will decide her future on the global stage."
spain.31.a:0 "What an Election"
spain.32.t:0 "The Comunión Tradicionalista!"
spain.32.d:0 "Franco's announcement of the victory quickly breaks the silence of the room, as the carlist power of the Comunión Tradicionalista revels in its victory. The party members carry Manuel Fal Conde on their hands, while Fal Conde himself sings Oriamendi, the anthem of the carlist movement. The other parties seem to take the final vote a lot less lightly. The falangists, as is tradition, have stormed out of parliament without a word, followed by many members of the CEDA. The alfonsists, while not particularly happy, do celebrate the fact that the bourbon monarchy will most likely be restored in less than a month, even if it is not their favorite candidate on the throne. With their victory, the carlists have finally all power in Spain and will most likely try to restore the kingdom of Spain that was ended so brutally after the Great War."
spain.32.a:0 "For God, the Fatherland and the King!"
spain.33.t:0 "The Renovación Española!"
spain.33.d:0 "The announcement of the alfonsist victory quickly broke the peace inside the building, as the big Alfonsist party celebrated its victory. Their celebratory happiness wasn't shared with the other parties, as both the Falange as the Carlists stormed out of the palace. The CEDA quietly followed soon after, leaving the alfonsists to continue their celebration."
spain.33.a:0 "The return of the king!"
spain.34.t:0 "The CEDA!"
spain.34.d:0 "In a shocking twist of events, the CEDA of José Maria has won the final vote by a margin, becoming the new rulers of Spain. The party was seen by many as an underdog, as their involvement with the old republic became a major point of critique. However, due to either a great campaign or a change in heart among the Spanish people, the CEDA has won. Their victory was quickly met with an outburst among the other parties, all leaving the parliament without even a congratulations. Whatever may be their reasoning, the CEDA now holds all power in Spain."
spain.34.a:0 "That's a twist"
spain.35.t:0 "...Nobody"
spain.35.d:0 "Silence fell upon the room filled by all party members, as Franco's announcement was slowly heard. Disgust and anger painted the faces of all men inside the building, urging Francisco Franco to leave the palace quickly. In a matter of seconds, the silence was torn apart by screams of the CEDA, CT, FE and RE, all in disbelief of the results. Chairs began to fly through the room, most likely hitting a person, leading to a brawl between the FE and the CT. Most guests escaped the building prior to the brawl, but any that were still there were caught in the crossfire of the Falangists and the Carlists. What will this mean for Spain?"
spain.35.a:0 "Nothing great, I tell you"
spain.36.t:0 "National Movement disbanded"
spain.36.d:0 "After the shocking results of the recent final vote, Spain is paralyzed by confusion. Seizing their opportunity, both the carlists and the falangists have declared the movement a complete failure and have personally abolished the movement, with the RE and the CEDA having no choice in the matter. This disbanding of the movement can surely only lead to catastrophe."
spain.36.a:0 "Great...."
spain.37.t:0 "Basque Train stopped by Spanish Border"
spain.37.d:0 "This morning, a train originating from Bilbao, the Basque capital, was stopped by Spanish border forces for inspection. In recent years, Spain has had a rather big problem with Basque people in Spain fleeing to the Basque Republic on trains and planes. Border forces are thus ordered to inspect every train that goes to Zaragoza and other surrounding cities and comes back to Bilbao. This time, in a surprising twist, our inspection forces found a batch of Basque men with guns in this particular train. Seconds after this discovery, the train went on its way, with ten of our border forces being killed and 23 wounded, dying on the rocky ground."
spain.37.a:0 "They will pay"
spain.38.t:0 "Ultimatum Drafted for the Basque Republic"
spain.38.d:0 "After the recent Basque train incident, several politicians in Madrid have stirred up the city for revenge. Many falangists and alfonsists have started to petition the government to send an ultimatum to the Basque Republic, demanding the right to investigate the incident and let the police have free reign in Bilbao for the supposed investigation. Many inside the leadership now that accepting such a demand would be equal to giving up independence to Spain and not accepting such a request would thus give Spain a great opportunity to invade the Basque Republic."
spain.38.a:0 "Let's send that ultimatum!"

##########Descriptions for leaders####
SPR_Mola_Desc:0 "Born on the 9th of July, 1887, on the tropical island of Cuba, Emilio Mola would never know rest in his life. Soon after his birth, the familie split, with the maternal branch joining the revolutionaries and Mola's father serving the Spanish forces. Quickly moving to the Spanish kingdom, Mola enrolled in the §YInfantry Academy of Toledo§! around 1910, serving in the Rif War as a Brigadier-General. Becoming one of Alfonso's favorites, Mola was rewarded with the position of Director-General of Security in 1906, being responsible for the growing Republican issue. However, his career as Director-General was short, as the §YSpanish Civil War of 1910§! would end the reign of Alfonso the 13th. The new Republican government initially wanted Mola executed for his royalist opinion, but with the help of CEDA and Falangist members, Mola became a military governor in §YNavarre§!. There he was able to drum up far-right support and, during the §YMary Coup§! was swiftly able to complete conquer the Basque region for the nationalist government. The death of Sanjurjo would, once again, begin Mola's career as Head of State. His paranoia has become a trademark of the Spanish security and his fear for the fifth column has drove Spain to near-constant purging."

POR_PAX_BRITANNICA_DESC:0 "Portugal, as one of the victors of the Great War, was gifted extensive colonial possensions on top of economic benefit and other Spanish territory. However, even with such a victory, Portugal remains in the shadow of Britain and Spain. The Spanish, while suffering from instability, have their revanchist eyes pointing to Lisbon and the British won't stay forever to protect Portugal. Divided by such a tense situation, Portugal has to forge its own path if it wants to see it survive as an independent nation, or it will perish and be forgotten in the future history lessons as another European state unable to modernize in time."
