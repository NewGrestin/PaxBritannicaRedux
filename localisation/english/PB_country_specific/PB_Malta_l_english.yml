  PB_MLT_Perpetual_Inquisition:0 "The Perpetual Inquisition"
  PB_MLT_Perpetual_Inquisition_desc:0 "Following the turmoil of the Great War, the Isle of Malta was left in a vulnerable state, its Bourbon backers and guarantors reduced to tatters and pulp. As the Fatima Revolution tore Portugal inside out and left Spain scarred into effective paralysis, the reactionary factions of the Order saw their perfect excuse to act.\n\nWith the full backing of the Church and the Office of the Inquisitor, the isles were placed under relentless surveillance. Every man was questioned, subjected to grueling interrogation and judgment. Dissent was crushed beneath the weight of faith and fear, ensuring that the rock, thrown squarely into the middle of the Mediterranean pond, would keep skipping... or so we hope."
  PB_MLT_Malta_Who:0 "The Maltese, Who Art Thou?"
  PB_MLT_Malta_Who_desc:0 "The Maltese people and their identity are somewhat ambigious, they speak a Semitic language with Italian elements, their identity is stretched far along from the docks of the Cottonera to the fields of Mgarr and the hills of Gozo. In spite of this, their identity remains mysterious to rest of the world."
  PB_MLT_Jewel_Mediterreanean:0 "Jewel of the Mediterreanean"
  PB_MLT_Jewel_Mediterreanean_desc:0 "As Malta recovered from its diplomatic freefall in recent years, its pristine position in the Mediterranean drew watchful and covetous eyes. Seeking to prove its value to the Great Empires, Malta has chosen to embrace its role as a strategic harbor. \n\nThe Grand Harbor now stands open to foreign navies—granted safe refuge in exchange for currency. With its arms wide and center stage in the world's most vital sea, Malta welcomes you."
