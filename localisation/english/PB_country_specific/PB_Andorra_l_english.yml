PB_ADR_Nascent_Pressure:0 "Nascent Pressure"
PB_ADR_Nascent_Pressure_desc:0 "The Bishopric of Andorra does not rule absolutely. In the quiet land and the mountains in and around Andorra, the Militia of Saint Ermengol, a division of the Congregation in Spain, continues to wage a campaign of terror from Andorra’s safe bases. Despite Spanish and French pressure in the past, the Bishopric cannot hold its own, as the Militia effectively holds the state hostage, serving as a High Castle of Fatimism, seeking to conduct a new Reconquista, just as their namesake did against the Muslims in 1020."
