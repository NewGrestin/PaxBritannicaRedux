  PB_YEM_Greater_Yemen:0 "Greater Yemen Realized"
  PB_YEM_Greater_Yemen_desc:0 "Roughly two decades ago the Zaidi Imamte was only a small satelite state allied to the Ottomans in the region. However the long Levantine war in the 20s would go perfectly in favor for the Iman. The Zaidis would face a combined coalition of Egyptians in Tahama, allied-local tribes in the South and East and Arab enemies to the north. Despite the isolation from the Ottoman main strength through mountainous warfare and uncoordinated enemies the Zaidi and Ottoman Forces would be defeat all enemy forces in the Yemen Region. When the Ceasefire came into effect in 1929 the Zaidi where in control of all of Yemen and had already archieved their Imans Dream of a Greater Yemen. With the Ottomans losing control of Hejaz and their connection to Yemen the Imamate would officialy cut ties with the Ottomans and pursue their own destiny."
  PB_YEM_Shia_Sunni_Divide:0 "The Shia-Sunni Divide"
  PB_YEM_Shia_Sunni_Divide_desc:0 "For the longest time the Zaidi Imamate was constrained to mountainous fertile regions of central Yemen where the Zaidi Shias reside. With the conquests of all Yemen they would now come to control all the Sunni Areas of Yemen aswell. The Population of the Imamate is now almost perfectly split into two same sized Shia and Sunni groups. Many of new Sunni-Subjects have large disdain for the Zaidis and conflict will likely only grow worse."
  PB_YEM_Reaping_Expansion:0 "Reaping the Expansion"
  PB_YEM_Reaping_Expansion_desc:0 "Throughout the Levantine War the Zaidi Imamate was able to defeat the local tribes of Southern and Eastern Yemen who had allied with the Arabs and Egyptians against the Ottomans. The local tribes and Sultantes resisted fiercly the invasions and many of their leaders still continue their fight in the mountains. A large number of leaders have fled to the British Aden Protectorate where they scheme their eventual return."
