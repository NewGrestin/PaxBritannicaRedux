PB_KLL_Free_State_desc:0 "Outcasts, social deviants, and all sorts of odd mishaped individuals call the 'nation' of Kelly their home. Ned Kelly has truely come to represent the pirates of modern day America, some sort of second coming of Blackbeard, both feared and loved by all. Kelly itself has become a sort of central hub for all of America's greatest bandits to congregate in, this has however drawed the concern of the surrounding states who regualry experience attacks from Kelly. If someone or something doesn't get the Kelly gang under control then they could forever cement the reality that is the Old American West.  "

PB_KLL_Always_Raiding_desc:0 "Because the Kelly Gang has no government nor economy to speak of the people who live in Kelly entirely rely on the wealth of others to support themselves and their families. Every father, brother, and son are expected to engage in the practise of raiding once they hit the age of 18, there are some farmers and cattle herders however these are often veterans who have reached an age that isn't hospitable to such messy environments. Should this form of 'tax collection' stop in any capacity, even minor, the nation of Kelly is going to have one hell of a field day, and the people of Kelly are not your typical suburban family. If they need a good meal, then they'll kill you for it."
