PB_WLA_Dunkirk_Corridor:0 "The Dunkerque Corridor"
PB_WLA_Dunkirk_Corridor_desc:0 "The Corridor de Dunkerque was ceded to Wallonia following the defeat of France in the Great War. Originally the city of Dunkerque was to be established as a free international city garrisoned by both British and Wallonian military forces. However, successful diplomatic pressuring by Germany forced London to concede to the newly drafted post war plan put forward by the international committee responsible for drawing the new borders of post war France.\n\nThe Corridor de Dunkerque or the Dunkirk Corridor now serves as the only port city under Wallonian possession and has become an area of contention between Liège and the Parisian government ever since the implementation of the Treaty of Tours. Despite these geo-political tensions Wallonia has benefited immensely from the trade Dunkirk brings and is unlikely to cede the territory back to France without a fight."
