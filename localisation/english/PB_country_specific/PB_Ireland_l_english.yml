  IRE_devlin_gov:0 "Devlin's Cabinet"
  IRE_devlin_gov_desc:0 "Despite the division and the heated political rhetoric, the 1932 Irish Elections, ostensiably called by Joseph Devlin to solidify his majority, failed to provide a conclusive result. The IPP has failed to make any major political gains and has been forced to rely on a shaky coalition of independents and local parties. There remains much to be done."
  IRE_military_exercises:0 "Permit Independent ICF Exercises"
  IRE_military_exercises_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Irish Commonwealth Forces lack the military experience of other nations, which has left us overly reliant on British arms and experience. By hosting ICF military exercises independent of the British, we can assert the relative independence of the Irish Commonwealth and our growing confidence on the battlefield."

  ireland.1.t:0 "The Secession Crisis"
  ireland.1.d:0 "The centre could not hold and the ICA has made its move. After seizing the Irish Parliament in Dublin, Lynch and his allies issued a unilateral declaration of independence from the British Empire. Though the Parliament was mostly empty, most reasonable politicians having left the city as tensions boiled, it was undoubtedly an electrifying speech. Knowing that the ICA will not be removed without force, the remnants of the Irish Parliament have been forced to muster their troops outside Dublin and prepare for confrontation.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the Irish Imperial Guards and their leader were quick to issue a statement which declared both the Dublin Government and the ICA as illegitimate. Strangely, they have not made any move yet..."
  ireland.1.a:0 "We shall pray reinforcements are on their way..."
  ireland.1.b:0 "Rally to the Citizen's Army!" 
  ireland.1.c:0 "The Government has failed us, the Guard must step in!"
  ireland.2.t:0 "Formation of the Irish Imperial Guards"
  ireland.2.d:0 "Claiming that law and order in Ireland has been thrown aside by the government, General Brookeborough has announced the formation of the Irish Imperial Guard, a paramilitary group to 'preserve both British and Irish interests in the face of chaos and rebellion.' Normally, this move would be all that was needed to court marshal the offending General but these are not normal times. With the vast majority of the Ulster Imperial Regiment flocking to his side, Brookeborough is in an unrivalled position and the cabinet fear that any attempt to bring the man in would undoubtedly see bloodshed."
  ireland.2.a:0 "For the love of God..."
  ireland.3.t:0 "Formation of the 'Citizen's Army'"
  ireland.3.d:0 "The downward spiral continues. Whilst the Government has floundered over its response to the deepening crisis, the newly formed Coalition of Irish Republicans has not been idle. In an extraordinary event happening in the very heart of our commonwealth, the man who spearheaded the formation of this new coalition, Liam Lynch, made a furious speech to gathered crowds ending in his proclamation of the creation of a new 'Irish Citizen's Army', bringing together the disaparate forces of dozens of paramilitary groups, gangs, and petty thugs into a singular force, and claiming that this new force would be 'the Shield which protects the great Irish people and the Sword to cut down those who would endanger them'."
  ireland.3.a:0 "And the Constabulary just watches..."
  ireland.4.t:0 "Devlin Approaches the IDL"
  ireland.5.t:0 "Ireland hit by the Crisis!"
  ireland.5.d:0 "The Irish economy, already weakened by its involvement in the Great War, was ill-prepared for the chaos wrought by the London Stock Crisis. With the Commonwealth's economy having been increasingly tangled with Imperial markets, the initial effects of the Crisis have inflicted havoc on the markets!"
  ireland.5.a:0 "We must weather the storm!"
  ireland.6.t:0 "General Brookeborough Protests ICF Exercises!"
  ireland.6.d:0 "As the extensive two weeks of military exercises for the ICF almost reach their end, General Brookeborough of the Ulster Imperial Regiment has launched a fiery attack on the exercises. Speaking to his regiment and limited members of the public, the General decried the exercises as 'a bastion of radical republican activity' where Irish Liberation Forces 'openly fraternised with sympathetic officers'. Whilst he provided no evidence to support these accusations, he went on to claim that the '(Irish Commonwealth) Government's eagerness to conduct exercises without our British Allies could only point to a republican infestation reaching the highest levels'\n\nThe Government has so far offered no response to the accusations but the comments show the sharp division which divides the ICF."
  ireland.6.a:0 "Another rabble rouser..."
  ireland.6.b:0 "Can't we remove this man from command?"
  ireland.7.t:0 "The King is Dead!"
  ireland.7.d:0 "Sombre news arrived from Westminster in the early hours of the morning, announcing the passing of HRH George V due to a sudden illness. The news has, predictably, seen a mixed reception in Ireland. Whilst the official response from the ruling government was limited to a tersely written message of condolences to the heir, Edward VIII, and royal family; The mood on the streets ranged from sombre mourning to celebration and outright burning of Royal Portraits.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the constabulary, many of these public gatherings soon gave way to clashes between opposing groups. Unionists and Republicans alike have already begun to blame the other side."
  ireland.7.a:0 "It is not our place to say whether we'll miss him..."
  ireland.8.t:0 "The Way Forward"
  ireland.8.a:0 "The IPP must endure this crisis alone"
  ireland.8.b:0 "Only together will Ireland survive"
  ireland.9.t:0 "Veterans' Association On Brink of Collapse"
  ireland.9.d:0 "The Irish Veterans' Association, one of our most beloved institutions, has made a desperate appeal to Devlin's government today. "
  ireland.9.a:0 "Reach across the aisle, we must save the IVA!"
  ireland.9.b:0 "No time to compromise, get them funds now."
  ireland.10.t:0 "Republicans filling Veterans gap"
  ireland.10.d:0 "Despite the Irish Parliament's messages of calm resolve in the face of economic crisis, the reality for many Irish families has been devastating and those who were just about surviving have been pushed into poverty and destitution. Compounded by the IVA's inability to provide given the massive surge in requests, the people feel abandoned, hungry, and ready to turn to alternate sources for help. To the dismay of Devlin and his cabinet, evidence suggest that it is the Irish Republican Brotherhood who the people have flocked to."
  ireland.10.a:0 "Very worrying."
  ireland.11.t:0 "The IDL Splits!"
  ireland.11.d:0 "Unionist YEET"
  ireland.11.a:0 "The extremes are empowered!"

  # Intro Events 
  irelandintro.1.t:0 "Disparate Voices of the Commonwealth"
  irelandintro.1.d:0 "The Parliament was full to the brim, despite the empty seats of those few radical unionist or republican MIPs, for the first session since the snap elections Devlin had called. A low murmur filled the halls as men from both aisles conversed with one another, though the divide was clear to see from a distant. Two distinct groups, the Dominionists and the Parliamentarians, and within those groups countless more divides, the Party Officials, the Independents, the Lesser Parties. Devlin rubbed his forehead as the session was called to order, he had come to reluctantly accept that this was the way of Ireland at the moment. Divisions within divisions all the way down, from parliament to families. It seemed that the common ground that kept them together was crumbling from beneath their feet.\n\nThe number of empty seats had grown since the last session, though he couldn't place which ones had gone to which side. Each time the number of MIPs semed to shrink, the people turning their back on the Commonwealth and the negotiations. His gamble to unite the people of Ireland hadn't entirely paid off but, thankfully, it hadn't completely failed either. Though times seemed desperate, Devlin was sure there would be a way through. Placing the crisp sheets of his speech on the stand before him, Devlin began, again, to try and instill some unity between his colleagues."
  irelandintro.1.a:0 "'Thank you, Mister Speaker, Gentlemen..."
  irelandintro.2.t:0 "The Opposition's Protege"
  irelandintro.2.d:0 "The day had been long, as all meetings of these kind tended to be, but the energy of the men around the young republican had not died down. They had simply reconvened from the meeting hall to the pub, swapped papers for a pint, and speeches for songs. Still, it made serious conversation rather difficult and Liam Lynch struggled to follow his conversation over the renewed chorus that had exploded next to him. It was bad luck that he had managed to corner none other than Cathal Brugha, head of the IRB, not at the convention but in the celebrations after. Not that it was their first meeting, the two had corresponded and conversed countless times over the last years, but the importance of their conversation now that made the experience frustrating.\n\nWhen the din had settled slightly, Brugha gave a smile and continued as if he hadn't been interrupted, 'To the outside, to the British generals who cower in London, and to the Unionists, they only see one organisation, a Republican boogeyman to stoke fears with. Doesn't matter which name they give it. 'Course when you look at it closely... Well. The IRB, the ILA, the IRA, NLA, the Trade Unions, and I could keep naming them. It's been like this for a hundred years now. We all thought the war might bring 'em all together but all it did was give them another reason to fall apart.' He frowned for a brief second, glancing over his shoulder.\n\nThere was a brief silence before Brugha began a new thought, 'My time as head of this organisation is coming to an end, I think, and...' Lynch interrupted him before he finished, 'You can't meant-?'\n\nBrugha gave a nod."
  irelandintro.2.a:0 "It is time for you to step up."
  irelandintro.3.t:0 "The Man From Ulster"
  irelandintro.3.d:0 "Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough, tutted as he read the latest headline, a piece on the latest of a series of attacks on Unionist groups, and the articles beneath, a torrent of articles on rising unemployment, poverty, and inequality. Every day, it seemed that the chaos grew and the lights went out on peace in Ireland. It was an unspoken truth were the blame was to be placed, on the doorstep of the Irish Parliament, the bastard creation of the Dublin Negotiations. A nest of corrupt republicans and paralysed dominionists, who had walked away from the rightful side of Unionism and surrendered too much to appease the other side.\n\nThankfully, these compromises meant that there had been an attempt to include all sides of the political spectrum in the process - Including Brookeborough's own unionists. The Irish Commonwealth Forces had approached him in the early days of the Commonwealth and reluctantly offered him a position, a lone general among a gang of nationalists. The Ulster Imperial Regiment served the Commonwealth, obviously, but it was no doubt that it was his own.\n\nPlacing the newspaper on the table next to him, Brookeborough turned his head to his attendant, 'Ready the car, I think I'll be inspecting the barracks early today'. With a nod, the man departed. Brookeborough smiled to himself, even if the rest of the country were to fall, he would not let Ulster be dragged with it."

  IRE_compromise:0 "The Unhappy Compromises" 
  IRE_compromise_desc:0 "After the disastrous spectre of the Great Famine almost brought Ireland to its knees, Irish Members of Parliament succeeded in their campaign to repeal the Act of Union. What followed was a lengthy period of political negotiation and reform which led to the creation of the Irish Commonwealth, known as the 'Dublin Negotiations'. Though these efforts were lauded as a success and victory of freedom and democracy, there would always exist those on both sides who would see the negotiations as too much given to the other side. Unionists claim that Ireland has been handed to the Republicans. Republicans claim that parliament is in the claws of Unionists. Whatever the truth, these divisions threaten the fabric of the Irish Commonwealth."

  IRE_first_colony_desc:0 "Hundreds of years of outside rule have left their bloody mark on Ireland.

  IRE_inexperienced_army:0 "The Society of United Irishmen"
  IRE_inexperienced_army_desc:0 "Formed in 1791, the United Irishmen were driven by a singular purpose — to free Ireland from the grip of the Crown. Inspired by the American Revolution and the rising fortunes of the French National Assembly, they moved in secret, forging ties with Jacobins in Paris and exiled American rebels. Their goal was clear: to tear down the Anglican rule that held Ireland in chains.\n\nWhen the British passed the Acts of Union, Ireland answered with steel and fire. Insurrection gripped the land. Brigades stormed Dublin, seized control, and surged through the north and east. In fear, the Parliament enacted the Act of Insurrection, granting the army unchecked power to crush all opposition.\n\nThey succeeded — the rebellion was drowned in blood. But the dream did not die.\n\nThe survivors fled, scattered across the world, but carried one thing with them — a promise. A vow to return, to reclaim their homeland, no matter the cost.\n\nIn exile, the United Irishmen became something greater: one of the world’s first multinational revolutionary movements. Bound by a common creed, they fought not only for an Irish republic, but for all peoples shackled by tyranny.\n\n\"A free form of government, and uncontrolled opinion on all subjects, are the common rights of all the human species.\""

Though the men who served did so with courage and tenacity, the High Command was riddled with issues, primarily stemming from each appointment being a bitter political issue. Even twenty years later, The Irish Commonwealth Forces have failed to shake their nickname; the 'Green Army', not only for the iconic Irish green but also for their lack of experience and many bungled operations."

A rare bipartisan effort from the Irish Parliament, the Irish Veterans' Association has helped to keep Veterans and their families from returning to poverty. Though some argue the measures do not do enough to ensure the safety of these men, the IVA has become a beloved public institution."
