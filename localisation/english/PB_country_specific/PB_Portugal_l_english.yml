  PB_POR_Home_of_Fatima:0 "Altar of the World’s Redemption"
  PB_POR_Home_of_Fatima_desc:0 "In October of 1917, three children in Portugal bore witness to a revelation that would shake the very foundations of the world. The Virgin Mary descended upon them, her voice a whisper of prophecy, foretelling a future of tribulation and reckoning. Few at the time could have foreseen the storm that would soon consume their nation. The people of Portugal, scarred by the infernal slaughter of the Great War, looked upon the apparitions not as mere vision but as an omen, a warning from the heavens themselves. And so, the seeds of divine upheaval were sown.\n\nThe Royalists, blind to the truth, sought to harness the League of Fátima for their own political ends, believing it to be but another instrument in their desperate game for power. The Fátimists knew better, hey knew that the war was but the first seal broken, the harbinger of tribulations yet to come. The land had long since turned its face from God, and now, the faithful would rise in defiance of a world that had forsaken him. José Alves Correia da Silva, Bishop of Leiria led the unstoppable tide of holy reckoning. \n\nAs the fires of chaos spread across Europe and the old order trembled, the power of the Fátimists grew. Then came the Twelve Demands, a proclamation of divine will. Chief among them, a command that King Luís II surrender his throne, not to any man, but to the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth. The Royalists, in their arrogance, dared to resist. They waged war against the chosen, but their steel and fire availed them nothing. The false monarchy was cast down. In Spain, faithful souls sought to kindle the same righteous fire, but there, the forces of darkness held stronger, and their crusade faltered. Portugal stands as a beacon of divine judgment in a world teetering on the brink of perdition. The kingdom of man has fallen. The kingdom of God has begun.\n\n§RPrepare for the blowing of the next trumpet.§!"
  PB_POR_Appalling_Recognition:0 "The Enmity of Revelation"
  PB_POR_Appalling_Recognition_desc:0 "§Y“Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?”§! §W- Galatians 4:16§!\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Fátima Revolution, the world responded with nothing but scorn and mockery, dismissing our sacred nation as nothing more than a mad, misguided frenzy. Yet, I ask you, let he who is without sin cast the first stone. For what is this mockery but the ignorance of those who have strayed from the divine path? And then, the Papacy, in its supposed wisdom, did not merely call for inaction but dared to urge us to "calm ourselves." Calm? In the face of divine revelation? What madness has the world fallen into? \n\n Alas, Portugal stands alone in its righteousness, and stand alone it will, for we have been cast aside by those who should have seen the truth. But let us not rush to blame them, for they do not yet see what is coming. They are blind to the signs, ignorant of the fate that awaits them, even as we, the faithful, march forward into the light of God’s judgment. May the Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
  PB_POR_Political_Schism:0 "A Crown of Splintering Thorns"
  PB_POR_Political_Schism_desc:0 "The Immaculate Kingdom was established upon the backs of those who bear the Crown of Thorns, yet the nature of this crown remains veiled, for Fátimism transcends the fleeting polities of man. No singular scripture nor printed manifesto can define its shape. What began as a divine revelation has become a fragmented vision, elusive and beyond mortal comprehension. From the moment of the Serene Regency’s proclamation, deep division took root. While many bowed to the rule of sacred right, others cried out for a republic, where the humble would ascend, casting off the yoke of rulers to claim dominion by their own declarations. Some longed for an egalitarian order, led not by power, but by divine grace.\n\n But dissenters, their voices silenced in fear, whispered of insurgency, sowing rebellion in secret places. In wrath, the hills bled dry, for thousands were taken in the Blessed Terror, their blood spilled to preserve the vision by force. The promise of salvation, intertwined with judgment, burns still in the hearts of those who would impose its will. The schism endures, and the Kingdom stands both as a mystery and a promise, with the crown ever splintering, its bearers forever marked by suffering."
  PB_POR_Front_Final_Judgement:0 "An Army for the End of Time"
  PB_POR_Front_Final_Judgement_desc:0 "Never bow before the corrupt thrones of men, nor the false idols of modernity. The world, steeped in sin and decadence, gazes upon the Holy Revolution with scorn and disbelief. Yet, this is the burden of the righteous, the path of the chosen is never one of ease or comfort, but of trial, sacrifice, and unwavering faith. The Revolutionary Guard of Consecration, sworn by blood and faith, carries forth the sword of purification. The wicked and the faithless believe themselves secure behind their secular walls, but the tide of redemption is rising, Portugal shall not remain isolated in its divine mandate."
