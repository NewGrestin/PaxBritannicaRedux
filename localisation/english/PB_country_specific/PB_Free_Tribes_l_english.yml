  PB_CFT_Union_of_86:0 "Union of the Eighty Six"
  PB_CFT_Union_of_86_desc:0 "The Confederacy of Free Tribes was founded in 1874 as a union of Great Plains native tribes after defeating the American settlers. In time, the Confederacy grew and expanded as more native tribes were displaced by Mexican, British and American expansion. The Confederacy has since become something of a Mecca for native americans, serving as a home for everyone from Seminole to Algonquin to Apache. Unfortunately, this policy of pluralism has made organizing a proper military somewhat difficult."
  PB_CFT_Nomadic_Divide:0 "Nomadic Divide"
  PB_CFT_Nomadic_Divide_desc:0 "The nature of the Confederacy means that tribes tend to be divided along those favoring agriculutre and those favoring a nomadic lifestyle. The former tend to form the base of the Confederate Army, while the latter tend to form the specialized forces such as recon and cavalry. Unfortunately, those favoring the nomadic lifestyle are generally resistant to new technological developments."
  PB_CFT_Resistance_to_Settlement:0 "Resistance to Settlement"
  PB_CFT_Resistance_to_Settlement_desc:0 "One of the founding principles of the Confederacy was that it would be the land of America's first people, and for the First Peoples alone. While this policy has relaxed over time, there is still a general distrust of outsiders. White settlements are limited to the borderlands and often are subjected to intimidation and raids by nomadic tribes, particularly the increasingly revanchist Chiricahua Band, whose massacres and scalping of white settlers have done little to improve tensions with the Anglosphere."

  POLITICS_Otetiani_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!03/06/1891\n\n§YOtetiani§! is a native born American with a troubled past. Holding a western education and originating from the Cherokee tribe has given Otetiani an unqiue outlook on politics and American life. Being a veteran of the Iberian campaign and Native-American national figure head has granted him the power and respect many chieftains before him lacked.\n\nThough an outsider may say that this nation stands as an untapped paradise the truth is unbearable to hear. Tribal rivalries run thick, cultural issues prevent social change, and corruption reigns supreme. And the westerners know this. With the Confederacy being fresh blood to the world stage many look to the nation and wonder what it has planned for the future. Wether it will crumble and fall like all those that came before, or if it will triumph in the face of tyranny as a mecca of Native-American peoples. Only time can tell."
