  PB_CHI_Peking_Conference:0 "Legacy of the Peking Conference"
  PB_CHI_Peking_Conference_desc:0 "The First Peking Conference was held in 1868 following the negotiated end of the Taiping Rebellion. The Conference was attended by a myriad of European powers, but most importantly it was another battleground between British and Russian influences. The most important part of the Conference was the official division of China under international law, with the Taiping Rebels and the Qing Empire forced to coexist as North and South China, officially referred to as “China-Peking” and “China-Tianjing”. Additionally, the Conference granted sweeping extraterritorial concessions to the European powers and forced both Chinas to acknowledge the independence of the Dali Sultanate.\n\nThis status quo was carefully maintained by the Chinese Reconstruction Administration, an organization managed by the principal European powers that first promulgated the Conference. Following the Russian invasion of Manchuria during the Great War, the CRA was reorganized into the Quadrilateral Commission, consisting of the United Kingdom, United Commonwealth, German Empire, and the Netherlands. The later collapse of the Qing Empire complicated affairs, however the intervention of Commission forces helped prevent the Revolutionaries from sweeping South into the moribund Southern empire."
  PB_CHI_Anglosphere_Military:0 "Anglosphere Military Mission"
  PB_CHI_Anglosphere_Military_desc:0 "Following the Peking Conference, the British Imperial Confederation approved the creation of a long-term military mission in China-Tianjing. The purpose of the mission was to train and equip the Heavenly Kingdom’s military to resist future incursions by the Qing Empire. In exchange, the Taiping granted economic concessions to Anglo-American interests, including granting the EIEC a near unlimited amount of autonomy within the country.\n\nDespite the disputes between London and Philadelphia, the Anglosphere remains unified in propping up South China, particularly after the collapse of the Qing Empire. The reforms of the Anglosphere mission have been readily adopted by the Empire’s standing army, however regional governors have been slow to adopt reforms in the conscripted local militias. Should the British Empire suffer §rcatastrophe§!, however, the mission may be forced to withdraw from the Empire for the foreseeable future."
  PB_CHI_Rengan_Reforms:0 "Legacy of the Rengan Reforms"
  PB_CHI_Rengan_Reforms_desc:0 "Hong Rengan, cousin to the Harmonious Emperor, was a pivotal figure in the post-Peking era of the Harmonious Empire. Critically, he was well educated and his ties to the emperor granted him a unique position of strength within the court. Rengan’s ties to the West and less radical Christian views made him more palatable to Western observers than many of the Taiping military radicals. This fact later proved valuable when Rengan represented the Taiping Rebels in the First Peking Conference, during which he gained favorable terms for the post-war borders of the Empire, albeit with significant concessions to the West.\n\nFollowing the Conference, Rengan would be challenged by Li Xiucheng, who saw Rengan as a traitor for agreeing to concessions. Xiucheng launched a coup in Tianjing and aimed to arrest Rengan and repudiate the concessions of the Conference, but failed to arrest Rengan, who in turn rallied loyalist troops and forced Xiucheng to surrender.\n\nWith his power base consolidated and Xiucheng now mortally challenged, Rengan set about reforming the Harmonious Empire into a functional nation-state. Notably, this included the creation of a central bank, various government oversight agencies, and a decentralization of the national treasury. Alongside other minor reforms, the Rengan Reform period electrified the empire’s economy, aided by the infusion of western capital via the concessions."
  
  PB_CHI_Southern_Expedition_Failure:0 "Aftershocks of the Southern Expedition"
  PB_CHI_Southern_Expedition_Failure_desc:0 "The Qing Empire fell in 1912, allowing the rise of the current people’s revolution in China. It was during this time that the Directory believed they could simply sweep south and undo the European-imposed division of China with the support of the people. Thousands of conscripts and revolutionaries moved south, eager to topple the Heavenly Emperor and carry the banner of the republic all the way to Dali.\n\nReality is often disappointing.\n\nThe Revolutionary Army was slammed by Imperial Forces in Hefei, who fought viciously to retain the city at any cost. The second blow came shortly thereafter, when the Quadrilateral Commission stepped into the war and proceeded to unleash the full arsenal of multiple European powers against us. Chemical warfare amalgamates and mechanized infantry broke the Army’s rear defenses and routed our forces all the way back to the pre-war border. Another blow was expected to fall and crush the revolution, but instead the Commission offered an off-ramp. The encircled force would be disarmed and allowed to return, but in exchange we would be forced to cede anything South of the Yellow River to the Harmonious Empire.\n\nThe Directory took the olive branch, believing it was more valuable to survive to repudiate the humiliation later than die fighting. The consensus was that the Commission lacked the manpower or will for major adventurism in China, and this had bought us time to consolidate.\n\nDespite putting a brave face on it, this was still a catastrophic defeat, and the Directory has since spent considerable effort into modernizing the Revolutionary Army. One day, the opportunity will arise to strike back against the Europeans and the Imperials, and when that day comes, we will be ready."
  PB_CHI_Second_Southern_Expedition:0 "Second Southern Expedition"
  PB_CHI_Second_Southern_Expedition_desc:0 " "
  PB_CHI_Revolution_Unrealized:0 "A Revolution Unrealized"
  PB_CHI_Revolution_Unrealized_desc:0 "The Anarcho-Republican Revolution in China has been an exercise in managing expectations. Since the Qing were overthrown, the state has hobbled from one crisis to another attempting to prevent everything from famine to outright counter-revolution. The one thing that can be said is that the people have maintained enthusiasm for the revolution.\n\nThat enthusiasm has kept the state afloat, for the most part, but people’s bellies can’t be filled with promises. If the Association remains dysfunctional, then the Directory and the people they claim to represent may find themselves violently opposed to one another."
  PB_CHI_First_Sister:0 "The First Sister Republic"
  PB_CHI_First_Sister_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Association is the second revolutionary state to emerge from Asia since the fall of the Japanese Empire. This places us in the unique position of being Tokyo’s favored son, at least for the moment. Japanese advisors are common throughout the military, as are Japanese investments and citizens. In a prior time, Beijing and Tokyo would have no common ground, but since the collapse of our respective autocrats, we’ve found common ground.\n\nThis isn’t to say the relationship is entirely born out of republican brotherhood.\n\nWhile Japan may be our allies for now, the future is uncertain, and we must ensure they do not become too comfortable lest they gain too much influence over the Directory. At the same time, the assistance of Japan is needed to modernize our fledgling military, and so we must simultaneously ensure that we do not upset the Japanese enough to force them to withdraw."

  PB_CHI_Unrestrained_Greed:0 "Unrestrained Oligarchy"
  PB_CHI_Unrestrained_Greed_desc:0 "The Quadrilateral Commission is run, principally, by corporate entities and oligarchs. This system, while extremely profitable for those involved, is less than stable as a state. The Commission itself functions more as a rubber stamp for the megacorporations, who have used the country as a trojan horse to hijack vast portions of the Harmonious Empire’s economy.\n\nThe corporations are concerned more with profitability over anything, and thus the Commission remains staunchly opposed to any future adventurism in China. The focus remains on maintaining South China as a captive economic partner for Anglo-European interests over any sort of reform. This system is, for the moment, functional, but the looming threat of general war in Asia has created a greater need for reform than ever.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the powers behind the Commission will anticipate the coming danger, however."
  PB_CHI_Corporate_Kingdom:0 "Corporate Kingdom"
  PB_CHI_Corporate_Kingdom_desc:0 "Tsingtao is the gateway for the West in China, and through it has poured all the bounties and failures that Europe can offer. While the Commission’s territories maintain a higher level of employment than the rest of China, worker’s rights are nonexistent and, in some areas, resemble rebranded serfdom. Factory complexes are jammed with underpaid Chinese workers, processing the raw goods of the Southern Empire for export to the wider world. Unions, or rather those that attempt to form, are frequently subject to intense scrutiny by local officials, most of whom are bought out by the megacorporations.\n\nFor the average American or European investor, the region is an untapped gold mine of manpower and material. For the Chinese, the proverbial dark of said gold mine is all they’ve known. The class consciousness of the Commission territory is still nascent, but as the anarchists in the North prepare for a second Southern Expedition, it seems primed to erupt in violent fashion."
  PB_CHI_Private_Army:0 "Soldiers of Fortune"
  PB_CHI_Private_Army_desc:0 "Officially, the Commission Territorial Army is a small force of only a handful of divisions. In reality, the official force is bolstered by a substantial army of paid mercenaries. Ranging from recruited Triads to ex-Pinkertons or exiled Portuguese soldiers, the pseudo-army of the Commission is a diverse force unified in their allegiance to the almighty Pound Sterling. Of course, maintaining the force is a major drain on capital, as is ensuring that it doesn’t act out.\n\nIt will be critical to keep the coffers full to ensure our so-called “Army” remains loyal. Defaulting on their paychecks without a recourse will likely have serious consequences for the health of the Commission’s leaders."

  PB_CHI_Ultramilitarist_Stronghold:0 "Ultramilitarist Stronghold"
  PB_CHI_Ultramilitarist_Stronghold_desc:0 "Manchuria was the birthplace of the Moscow Circle conspiracy, a cloak and dagger organ of the Russian military deeply opposed to the liberalizations of the current period. As St. Petersburg shifted from autocracy, reactionary elements of the military that were too vocal for their own good would often find themselves reassigned away from power. Often, this reassignment meant Manchuria, Mongolia, or even as far as the Americas. For the lucky few, Harbin became a breeding ground for a conspiracy that would ultimately worm into the highest levels of Russian high command.\n\nThe effect on Manchuria itself is noticeable. Russian chauvinist policy dominates the sham Duma, where the Chinese are treated as second class colonials in their own country. Manchu and Chinese women are frequently pressured into marrying Russians, adopting Russian names, and abandoning cultural traditions in favor of those preferred by the Circle. The only true route to legitimate citizenship for the population remains absolute assimilation, a humiliating process that even once completed can be revoked without recourse.\n\nFor the moment, Russia seems content to overlook these eccentricities, but as resistance grows to the regime, it may be forced to look further into the dirty business of their “Yellow Russian” ambitions."
  PB_CHI_Far_from_Home:0 "On the Hills of Manchuria"
  PB_CHI_Far_from_Home_desc:0 "Far from home and surrounded by enemies, Zheltorossiya is the independent arm of Russian influence in the Middle Kingdom. Since the calcification of the Russian occupation, it has become the launch point for various interventions, particularly the recent intervention in Xinjiang.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Qing, the Tsardom moved to occupy Outer Mongolia, establishing the Mongol Principality as a client state. Similarly, when the armies of the would-be modern Timur, Ma Zhongying, pressed towards the Central Asian border, the Tsardom answered in kind.\n\nNow, the Tsarist army remains overextended, committed to fighting the rebel groups of our protectorates while keeping watch for the inevitable return of the Japanese. North China sits across the border, with their degenerate anarchists ready to tear down the Tsardom and replace it with chaos.\n\nEnemies sit at all the edges of our Empire, and we must fight viciously if we are to protect what is rightfully ours."
