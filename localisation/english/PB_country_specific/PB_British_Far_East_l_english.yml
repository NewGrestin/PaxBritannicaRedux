  PB_BFE_Colonial_Insurrection:0 "Colonial Insurgency"
  PB_BFE_Colonial_Insurrection_desc:0 "This nation is a colony or administrative subdivision of another nation, currently combatting a localized uprising. Due to the less severe nature and lower intensity nature of the conflict, the scope of the war is kept at a local level."
  PB_BFE_Lion_and_Rooster:0 "The Lion and the Rooster"
  PB_BFE_Lion_and_Rooster_desc:0 "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. This motto couldn't be so true when it comes to Britannia's way of handling Indochina. \n\nAlthough resentment remains vivid between us, the French remainders in Annam understand very well their sole guarantee of keeping their privileges untouched is to support our initiative fully. And so do we know keeping them around might help us in dealing with the locals — which perceive the froggies under a better light than our newborn administration. From this simple observation came an obvious answer — yet one not so easy to accept after years of slaughter in the trenches. \n\nFor now, the safeguard of civilization has allowed us to put aside this uneasiness. Nonetheless, our alliance with the French settlers might be compromised the moment this sacred mission against barbarism is brought to a conclusion."
  
  PB_BFE_Tripod_Panic:0 "Tripod Panic"
  PB_BFE_Tripod_Panic_desc:0 "The successful introduction of mechanised walkers on the field has left the Northern barbarians in disarray. Agile and robust, our machines have crushed the very moral of our enemies into pulps. \n\nUntil the Viets catch up with this newborn menace, their fear and dismay shall benefit our civilisational work."
