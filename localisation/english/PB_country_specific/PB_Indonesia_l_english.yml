  PB_CCO_Bandit_Alliances_desc:0 "Elements of the former East Indies Navy and local pirate groups combined into a multi-island thalassocracy. An extremely diverse alliance of bandit groups hailing from as far as North America, India, China and Indochina now threaten trade through Indonesia. Their current aim is to consolidate their rule and power and expand the profits from piracy, maybe eventually expending their influence and establish a martime pirate republic."
