  PB_NOR_Norwegian_Resistance:0 "The Nasjonal Uavhengighetsallianse"
  PB_NOR_Norwegian_Resistance_desc:0 "The Collapse of the European economy following the Great War effectively demolished the German-reliant Danish economy, and by extension, the Norwegian economy. Norway's comparatively smaller, often agrarian economy was utterly decimated by the shift. This collapse lead to renewed calls for complete Norwegian independence, and ultimately saw the foundation of the Nasjonal Uavhengighetsallianse, or National Independence Alliance.\n\nThe NU has become a big tent of various resistance groups, ranging from Sapmi separatists to hardcore nationalists and Jacobins, united in an unholy alliance to expell the perfidious Danes from Norway at any cost. Though open support is limited at this point among the populace, it is widely believed that elements of the Norwegian government have their sympathies with the NU. If the NU is not contained, then they will find a way to seize Norwegian independence, no matter the cost."
