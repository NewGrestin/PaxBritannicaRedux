FST_Brevie_Government:0 "The Brévié Government"
FST_Brevie_Government_desc:0 "Jules Brévié's collaborator government is the only stabilising force in the country's increasingly restless social climate. While his attempts at reform are usually subverted or vetoed by the German authority, Brévié remains an assertive and principled governor capable of maintaining some semblance of harmony between the Australiens and their German 'protectors'. Many both within and out of the government see him as the only thing standing between Australie and total disorder."
FST_German_Economic_Dominance:0 "German Economic Dominance"
FST_German_Economic_Dominance_desc:0 "While Australie is officially independent, its economy is completely dominated by German interests. The German Pacific Commonwealth directly controls all major Australien ports, and with it all Australien imports and exports. This immense economic influence is felt throughout much of Australien society, and is doing little to endear the German 'protectors' to the populace."
FST_Forced_Demilitarisation:0 "Forced Demilitarisation"
FST_Forced_Demilitarisation_desc:0 "Australie was heavily demobilised following the Great War, and is still allowed little more than a token force by its German masters. As a result, the country is totally reliant on the German Pacific Commonwealth for protection and lacks any sort of basis for an officer corps or doctrinal evaluation."
FST_Rising_Unrest:0 "Rising Unrest"
FST_Rising_Unrest_desc:0 "Conditions in Australie have hardly improved since the Great War, with local rights and reforms frequently curtailed by German officials for their own benefits or short-term gains. Many fear tensions in Australie are reaching a boiling point, and may result in a widespread revolt against German authority if pushed too far."
