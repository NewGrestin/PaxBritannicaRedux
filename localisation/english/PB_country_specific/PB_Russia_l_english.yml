  RUS_mikhail_alexandrovich: "Mikhail Alexandrovich"
  RUS_mikhail_alexandrovich_regnal: "Mikhail II"
  RUS_mikhail_alexandrovich_leader_desc: "§HBorn:§! §Y4/12/1878 in Saint Petersburg, Saint Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n\nBorn as §YMikhail Alexandrovich§!, then adopting his regnal name §YMikhail II§! has served the throne for over fifteen years, his time spent as Russia’s newest Tsar has been one of continued reform, political radicalization, and economic growth. It is in these years that Russia has fundamentally transformed itself into one of the leading powers of the world, holding dominion over Eurasia and the Americas with one of the largest standing armies in the world. It was with this army in the war-torn fields of Siberia during the Great War where Russia spilt its fair share of blood against the encroaching Japanese forces, Mikhail’s father had known this fact well but failed to secure for the Russian Empire its well-deserved spoils of war. What Mikhail had inherited was a nation hungry to see its flag flying over London, its old allies repaying their long overdue debts, and most importantly of all, to see the Russian Empire achieve its ambitions of global dominance. Mikhail though is a pragmatic man, dreams of empire are often not achieved overnight, these processes take time, effort, and luck. Everyone Russian deep down knows what’s to come, as so does their Tsar, Mikhail may have let the people of his empire enjoy the benefits of democracy, but this has come at a cost. Democracy for empire, that was the deal Mikhail made to his people, and its one he expects repayment on soon."

  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\nThe incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders_desc:0 "Russian history is a constant tug of war between reform and reaction, and this is most acutely felt with the last two Tsars of the Empire. Alexander II is, at least in contemporary times, viewed as a Second Peter the Great. His son, on the other hand, is viewed far less favorably.\n\nAlexander II's reforms, spurred on by his failed assassination, laid the groundwork for Russia's ascendance to global superpower status. His patronage of Nikola Tesla lead to Russia developing an overnight high technology industrial sector, and transformed the Imperial Military into a modern fighting force able to project Russian power anywhere in Eurasia.\n\nAlexander III, while he attempted to continue his father's reforms, found himself caught in the whirlwind of the Great War. The Butchered Victory was ultimately laid at his feet, and the National Rebellions of the 1920s destroyed his credibility. The exact sequence of events in the court that lead to his abdication are not, and may never be, known, but they culminating in his son Mikhail ascending the throne as Tsar Mikhail II.\n\nMikhail has been pragmatic enough to continue the reforms of his forebears, perhaps hoping that standing on the shoulders of giants will once again lead Russia to greatness."

In Russia, the democratic experiment has been an exercise in tension. Political parties have formed, split, and disbanded in the time it takes to finish lunch. Anarchists and nationalists engage in fistfights in the streets. Anywhere you look, you can strike sparks with the right look or the right words.\n\nFor many nations, the birth of democracy is a slow, delicate process.\n\nFor Russia, thus far it has been a bloody and violent and in many cases humiliating. In the end, though, it will be worth the pain.\n\n§RAssuming that the democratic experiment succeeds, of course.§!"

  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising_desc:0 "One of the biggest demograghic shifts of the Second Renaissance was the birth of the Russian middle class. For most of its' history, Russia was a country of haves and have-nots, with very little in between. As the industrial sector developed, however, the power of the nobility and the landowners was increasingly undermined by a growing caste of moderately wealthy former peasants.\n\nThese people would form the foundation of a middle class that would grow and mature to rival Russia's historic interest groups, and form the foundations for the rise of democracy. With industry came stable jobs, and with stable jobs came stable homes, and from that came the need for education, literacy, higher education, and intellectualism.\n\nThe middle class now forms the backbone of Russia's burgeoning political scene, and they will tenaciously defend their gains if need be."

  Russian_Politics.1.t:0 "Third Meeting of the Provisonal Duma"
  Russian_Politics.1.d:0 "The grand chamber of the Imperial Duma in St. Petersburg resonated with a low hum—not of conversation, but of the hundreds of mechanical augmentations carried by its delegates. The vaulted ceiling, an intricate lattice of brass and stained glass, cast fractured sunlight over the chamber. Steam hissed from hidden vents, and the tick-tock of ornamental gears embedded in the walls seemed to echo the anxious energy of the gathering.\n\nThis was the Duma's third session, convened to prepare for the Empire's first democratic elections, a controversial concession by Tsar Mikhail. His throne still dominated the room from an elevated dais, though he was absent, symbolizing the fragile balance of autocracy and reform the assembly struggled to achieve.\n\nThe debates primarily focused on the constitutional issue of autonomism in the regional Dumas. These Dumas, centered in the Ukraine and Poland, were a concession from the 1920s Nationalist Rebellions. The main issue is the concern that conceding to these regional administrations may embolden future demands by nationalist movements."
  Russian_Politics.1.a:0 "Can you all stop fighting for five minutes?"

  Russian_Politics.2.t:0 "Discussions on Regional Autonomy"
  Russian_Politics.2.d:0 "The air in the grand chamber of the Imperial Duma was thick with tension as the delegates debated the contentious proposal of granting limited autonomy to regional administrations in Ukraine and Poland. Beneath the stained-glass dome, the flicker of gaslight mingled with the mechanical glow of augmented limbs and clockwork scribes recording every heated exchange.\n\nThe Autonomists, represented by figures from the periphery of the Empire, presented plans for regional Dumas which would be subservient to Moscow but allotted some power to adjust laws as needed. The idea, they feel, would help sooth concerns from the Empire’s minorities that the new democratic system will be used as a cudgel against minorities.\n\nOpposing this, the Centralists feel that granting even a small level of autonomy to these groups will just further embolden future rebellions.\n\nThe issue comes down to a vote in the Provisional Duma…"
  Russian_Politics.2.a:0 "One Russia, One Duma"
  Russian_Politics.2.b:0 "Perhaps we can be a bit more experimental?"

  Russian_Politics.3.t:0 "Preparing for St. Petersburg"
  Russian_Politics.3.d:0 "The opulent halls of the Winter Palace were abuzz with quiet urgency as Tsar Mikhail II met with his closest advisers and security officials to finalize preparations for his upcoming public appearance in Saint Petersburg. The event, intended as a display of imperial unity and progress, had drawn widespread attention—and a growing list of concerns.\n\nIn the Tsar’s private chamber, the scent of polished mahogany and oil from the mechanical prosthetics of his advisers mingled with the tension in the air. The Tsar himself, a stately figure with a subtle spinal augmentation to maintain his posture during grueling public engagements, listened intently as Protopopov, head of the Interior Ministry, laid out the threats.\n\nThe principal concern was the public nature of the event. With such a large crowd, Protopopov fears that one or more gunmen could easily enter the crowd and attack. Secondarily, he cited events in Occupied Galicia which indicate a marked decrease in rebel activity. While some might view this as positive, Protopopov feels the opposite, stating that he believes this may be the buildup to a larger attack.\n\nThere are concerns, however, that a larger security presence might give off the wrong idea to the public."
  Russian_Politics.3.a:0 "A Tsar must stand with his people."
  Russian_Politics.3.b:0 "...but perhaps some extra security wouldn't hurt."

  Russian_Politics.4.t:0 "Anti-Tsarist Agitation"
  Russian_Politics.4.d:0 "The royal train hissed to a halt at the bustling Saint Petersburg station, its brass-clad exterior gleaming under the winter sun. Tsar Mikhail II stepped onto the platform, flanked by his personal guard, their steam-assisted armor glinting as they moved with precision. A carefully curated crowd of loyal subjects cheered, waving imperial banners embroidered with the double-headed eagle.\n\nYet beyond the carefully managed reception, the atmosphere of the city was far less jubilant.\n\nAcross Nevsky Prospekt, anti-Tsarist protests had erupted, the angry voices of industrial workers, disillusioned students, and regional autonomy advocates reverberating through the frosty air. Signs denouncing the monarchy, painted with slogans like “Freedom for the People” and “No More Chains,” were held aloft, while others called for solidarity with the Polish and Ukrainian movements.\n\nAs the Tsar’s motorcade departed the station, a detachment of mounted police moved to confront the protesters. Clad in riot armor reinforced with steel plating, the officers advanced methodically, their electro-batons crackling ominously. The crowd resisted, hurling stones and bottles, but the police, supported by mechanized drones hovering overhead, quickly subdued the unrest. Protesters were arrested en masse, some dragged into waiting vehicles, others fleeing into the maze of side streets.\n\nThe Tsar said nothing, his gaze fixed on the fading smoke of overturned barrels and banners. As the motorcade approached the Winter Palace, the cheers of loyalists replaced the sounds of unrest, but the unease lingered. Saint Petersburg, the heart of the Empire, was restless, and the cracks in its foundations were becoming harder to ignore."

  Russian_Politics.5.t:0 "Concerning Radio Chatter from Galicia"
  Russian_Politics.5.d:0 "Intelligence Report\n\nClassification: Top Secret\n\nSubject: Intercepted Radio Communications Indicating Possible Polish Partisan Attack on Saint Petersburg\n\nSummary:\n\nRecent intercepted radio transmissions from suspected Polish partisan groups operating in Galicia suggest plans for a coordinated attack in Saint Petersburg during Tsar Mikhail II's current visit. The chatter indicates potential collaboration among various nationalist cells, leveraging urban sympathizers and foreign support.\n\nDetails:\n\nIntercept Overview:\n\nFrequency monitored: 12.85 MHz (encrypted partisan channel).\n\nKey phrases detected: “Phoenix rises,” “target at the Winter Sun,” and “strike at the heart.”\n\nAnalysis of Phrases:\n\n“Phoenix rises” is a known codeword within Polish nationalist groups for a major coordinated operation.\n\n“Target at the Winter Sun” is assessed as a reference to the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg.\n\n“Strike at the heart” implies an attack aimed at the imperial leadership.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nImmediately increase security measures at all public appearances of the Tsar.\n\nDeploy additional plainclothes agents and augmented police units to monitor high-risk locations in Saint Petersburg.\n\nConduct raids on suspected nationalist cells in Galicia and urban centers within the capital.\n\nEnforce heightened scrutiny at all transportation hubs and incoming cargo shipments."
  Russian_Politics.5.a:0 "It's probably nothing."
  Russian_Politics.5.b:0 "Send some agents to investigate, just in case."

  Russian_Politics.6.t:0 "The Tsar Arrives in St. Petersburg"
  Russian_Politics.6.d:0 "Inside the palace, the atmosphere was a blend of tradition and change. The ornate chandeliers and gilded moldings of the chamber bore witness to centuries of autocratic rule, while the gathered representatives of the Duma symbolized a cautious step toward modern governance. The Provisional Duma, tasked with organizing Russia’s first national elections, had become a crucible of competing visions for the Empire's future.\n\nSeated at the head of the table, the Tsar listened attentively as Pyotr Stolypin, the Prime Minister, outlined plans for the elections. Discussions ranged from the logistics of voting in remote provinces to the thorny issue of ensuring representation for regions like Ukraine and Poland, where calls for greater autonomy had stirred tensions.\n\n“Your Majesty,” Stolypin concluded, “these elections will mark a historic moment for the Empire. But they also come with risks. The forces of nationalism and dissent could exploit this process to further divide us.”\n\nMikhail II, his posture regal and composed, responded with deliberate authority. “Unity must remain our guiding principle,” he said. “The Empire’s strength lies in its diversity, but that strength must be tempered by loyalty. The elections will proceed, but the integrity of the Empire will not be compromised.”\n\nThe meeting ended with an air of cautious optimism, though unease lingered beneath the surface. As the Tsar departed for his private chambers, the Duma members returned to their deliberations, acutely aware that their work was under the watchful gaze of both the Tsar and the restless Empire beyond the palace walls."
  Russian_Politics.6.a:0 "Let's see what the Russian people have to say."

  Russian_Politics.7.t:0 "Agents Report back from Galicia"
  Russian_Politics.7.d:0 "Intelligence Report\n\nClassification: Top Secret\n\nSubject: Polish Resistance Preparations for Major Offensive\n\nSummary:\n\nField agents embedded in Galicia report significant escalations in Polish nationalist activity, indicating preparations for a coordinated large-scale attack. Resistance forces appear to be mobilizing resources and personnel, with a focus on high-value targets in both Galicia and the Russian interior.\n\nDetails:\n\nResistance Activity:\n\nIncreased movement of personnel between rural strongholds and urban centers.\n\nStockpiling of weapons, including advanced mechanized explosives and retrofitted combat drones.\n\nUse of encrypted radio channels and underground communication networks to coordinate activities.\n\nKey Intelligence:\n\nLogistics hubs near Lwów and Tarnów have reported unexplained thefts of industrial equipment, likely repurposed for sabotage or assault operations.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nImmediate deployment of additional military units to Galicia for counterinsurgency operations.\n\nStrengthen security protocols in Saint Petersburg and other major cities, with particular focus on vulnerable infrastructure.\n\nConduct targeted raids on suspected resistance hideouts to disrupt planning efforts.\n\nIntensify diplomatic efforts to pressure European powers suspected of supporting Polish factions."
  Russian_Politics.7.a:0 "We can address this after the festivities."

  Russian_Politics.8.t:0 "The Tsar meets with the Locals"
  Russian_Politics.8.d:0 "As part of a carefully orchestrated propaganda tour ahead of Russia's historic national elections, Tsar Mikhail II convened with local officials in Saint Petersburg at the opulent Winter Palace. The event was designed to emphasize the Tsar’s role as a unifying figure guiding the Empire into a new era of constitutional governance while retaining its imperial heritage.\n\nThe meeting, broadcast via radio and kinegram, showcased the Tsar’s engagement with municipal leaders and regional administrators. Flanked by members of the Provisional Duma, Mikhail II listened attentively as officials outlined local infrastructure projects, public welfare programs, and preparations for the election process.\n\nThe Tsar addressed the assembly with a tone of measured optimism, emphasizing the need for balance between modernization and traditional Russian values. “This election is not merely a political milestone,” he declared, “but a testament to the unity and resilience of the Russian people under the banner of the Empire.”\n\nOutside the palace, crowds of loyalists and onlookers gathered, waving imperial banners and chanting slogans in support of the Tsar. Security was tight, with augmented guards patrolling the area amid heightened concerns of unrest. Critics, however, have dismissed the tour as a superficial display aimed at masking deeper societal fractures."
  Russian_Politics.8.a:0 "I'm sure we can address their concerns."

  Russian_Politics.9.t:0 "Okhrana Officials Angered"
  Russian_Politics.9.d:0 "In the wake of a devastating terrorist attack in Saint Petersburg, orchestrated by Polish and Baltic rebels, the leadership of the Okhrana has faced intense scrutiny and blame for failing to prevent the assault.\n\nAt an emergency meeting convened in the Imperial Council Chamber, Chief Director Stepan Beletsky and his senior advisors defended the agency's actions. Beletsky expressed indignation at what he called “misplaced accusations” against the Okhrana.\n\n“We provided actionable intelligence on increased insurgent activity weeks before this tragedy,” Beletsky declared, addressing both the Tsar and the gathered ministers. “Our warnings about lax regional security and the flow of foreign arms into the Empire were not heeded with the urgency required.”\n\nThe meeting reportedly grew heated as members of the Provisional Duma demanded accountability, accusing the Okhrana of underestimating the rebels' coordination and technological capabilities. Some critics within the Council have suggested the agency’s traditional methods may be inadequate in an era of mechanized insurgency and advanced communication technologies."
  Russian_Politics.9.a:0 "Use the opportunity to replace the leadership."

These actions are being framed as "retribution" for the attack, which has been attributed to Polish and Baltic insurgents.\n\nScope of Incidents:\n\nReports indicate coordinated assaults on Polish villages and neighborhoods near Lwów, Tarnów, and Brest-Litovsk.\n\nViolence includes arson, looting, and physical attacks on individuals identified as Polish by language, dress, or residence.\n\nSeveral incidents have escalated to the destruction of Catholic churches and schools, further inflaming local tensions.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nImmediate reinforcement of military units in affected areas to prevent further escalation.\n\nStrategic outreach to Polish leaders within the Empire to negotiate de-escalation measures and rebuild trust."

  Russian_Politics.11.t:0 "Operation Azalea Briefing"
  Russian_Politics.11.d:0 "Operation Azalea – Quick Occupation and Dissolution of the Galician Occupation Government\n\nImperial Russian High Command\n\nClassification: Top Secret\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective of Operation Azalea is to swiftly occupy key positions in Galicia and dismantle the Galician Occupation Government (GOG), a collaborationist regime that has increasingly shown signs of infiltration by Polish independence activists. The operation seeks to neutralize potential threats to Russian imperial interests and prevent the GOG from becoming a conduit for insurgent activity.\n\nPlan Overview:\n\nOperational Goals:\n\nSeize control of government buildings, military installations, and communication hubs in Lwów, Tarnów, and other major cities within Galicia.\n\nArrest key figures within the GOG suspected of collaborating with or sympathizing with Polish nationalist groups.\n\nExpected Timeline:\n\nThe operation is expected to take no longer than 72 hours for initial occupation and the dissolution of the Galician Occupation Government, with a secondary stabilization phase lasting up to two weeks depending on the level of resistance."
  Russian_Politics.11.a:0 "Begin the deployments."

  Russian_Politics.12.t:0 "Krakow under Martial Law"
  Russian_Politics.12.d:0 "With Galicia once again under martial law, the decision has come to decide what to do with the newly acquired territory. Three proposals have been put forward.\n\nWe can fully annex the Galicia territory into Russia proper. This would be directly beneficial but would intensify anti-Russian attitudes among the Polish population.\n\nWe can partition the land between Russia and Poland, giving some concessions to the Polish Autonomy. Not a perfect solution, but it would serve as an olive branch to the Polish population.\n\nThe third, and most radical, is to fully award the territory to Poland. This would be a massive boon for the Poles, effectively restoring greater Poland within the Russian Empire."
  Russian_Politics.12.a:0 "Retain the land as direct provinces of the Russian Empire"
  Russian_Politics.12.b:0 "Split the land between Russia and Poland"

  Russian_Politics.13.t:0 "Operation Azalea Discovered!"
  Russian_Politics.13.d:0 "Operation Azalea has been detected!\n\nThe Occupation government of Galicia has discovered our plans for a radical takeover and begun measures to resist Russia’s invasion. Polish militants are now flooding the country, ready to take up arms against the Russian Army moving into the region.\n\nThis has greatly complicated the situation in Russian Poland."
  Russian_Politics.13.a:0 "I suppose we're doing this the more direct way, then."

  Russian_Politics.18.t:0 "The Tsarina endorses the Church"
  Russian_Politics.18.d:0 "In the wake of Tsar Mikhail II's tragic death during the Saint Petersburg attacks, Grand Duchess Olga, now serving as Tsarina of the Russian Empire, has begun to assert her authority over the direction of the Empire's future. In a significant shift of both religious and political focus, she has publicly endorsed the Cosmist wing of the Russian Orthodox Church, calling for a more prominent role in government affairs.\n\nThe Cosmist movement, a blend of religious orthodoxy and forward-thinking philosophies on human progress and technological integration, has long been a fringe faction within the Russian Orthodox Church. However, under the reign of Tsarina Anna, the Cosmist ideals are now seen as a cornerstone for Russia’s renewal. In a statement made to the Duma, she declared that the Cosmist’s vision of harmonizing humanity’s spiritual and technological advancements aligns with the Empire's need to modernize in both governance and culture.\n\nAnna has called for the formation of a new advisory council that would include prominent Cosmist theologians and scholars to help guide the Russian Empire’s future, particularly in terms of its engagement with machine-human augmentation and genetic advancements, which have become more common among the elite and military classes. Anna's endorsement marks a shift away from the more conservative, traditional factions within the Church that had long opposed such innovations."
  Russian_Politics.18.a:0 "We appreciate her opinions but..."
  Russian_Politics.18.b:0 "Perhaps this is what we need?"

  Russian_Politics.19.t:0 "Church and State"
  Russian_Politics.19.d:0 "As part of her efforts to stabilize the Russian Empire following the assassination of Tsar Mikhail II during the Saint Petersburg attacks, Grand Duchess Olga, now serving as Tsarina, has initiated a significant restructuring of the government. In a bold move to address the growing tension between secular elements of the Provisional Duma and the Orthodox faithful, she has announced the creation of new government offices specifically designated for members of the Cosmist wing of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThese offices, collectively referred to as the Council of Divine Progress, are intended to integrate the spiritual and philosophical guidance of the Cosmists into the governance of the Empire. The council will focus on matters such as ethical oversight of genetic and mechanical augmentation programs, fostering a sense of unity between spiritual values and technological advancements, and advising on educational reforms to instill Cosmist ideals in future generations."
  Russian_Politics.19.a:0 "Perhaps we can compromise on secularism."
  Russian_Politics.19.b:0 "Invite Vvedensky's Cosmists in an advisory role."

  Russian_Politics.20.t:0 "Worrying Communications"
  Russian_Politics.20.d:0 "The Russian government has been rocked by the discovery of a series of encrypted transmissions intercepted by the Okhrana, the Empire's state security agency. These transmissions, traced to anonymous sources, were sent to military units across the Empire, including those stationed in key strategic locations such as Moscow, Kiev, and Vladivostok.\n\nPreliminary decryption efforts reveal vague but alarming phrases suggesting the coordination of troop movements, the mobilization of key assets, and coded references.\n\nThe discovery has sent shockwaves through the Provisional Duma and the military high command, which now face mounting concerns about potential disloyalty within their ranks. The Grand Duchess has reportedly ordered an immediate lockdown of high-security installations, a temporary halt to troop deployments, and a review of all military communication networks."
  Russian_Politics.20.a:0 "We need to look into this."

  Russian_Politics.21.t:0 "Missing Weapons"
  Russian_Politics.21.d:0 "The Russian government has uncovered a troubling breach in the Empire's military infrastructure: a significant number of weapons, including rifles, machine guns, and ammunition, have been reported missing from military depots across the country. Investigations led by the Okhrana revealed that inventory records at several depots were systematically forged to conceal the thefts, suggesting a coordinated and well-planned operation.\n\nThe missing weapons are believed to number in the thousands, with their absence noted in depots from key strategic regions such as the Caucasus, Ukraine, and Siberia. The thefts were initially detected during a routine audit of supplies following reports of irregularities in ammunition requisitions. Forensic analysis of the forged documents indicates a high level of expertise, fueling suspicions of internal involvement."
  Russian_Politics.21.a:0 "Continue to probe the situation"
  Russian_Politics.21.b:0 "We can't risk alienating the military"

  Russian_Politics.22.t:0 "The Plot Thickens"
  Russian_Politics.22.d:0 "A shocking breakthrough in the ongoing investigations into missing weapons and intercepted encrypted transmissions has revealed a direct connection to high-ranking members of the Russian Imperial military. A joint operation by the Okhrana and loyal military intelligence units uncovered evidence that implicates several senior officers in orchestrating both the theft of arms and the dissemination of coded messages.\n\nThe plot appears aimed at destabilizing and seizing control of the Empire through a coordinated military uprising. The conspirators, many of whom are decorated veterans with substantial influence over their troops, have been linked to ultranationalist factions dissatisfied with the regency's recent reforms, including the growing role of the Provisional Duma and Cosmist clergy."
  Russian_Politics.22.a:0 "Have those involved arrested!"

  Russian_Politics.23.t:0 "Communications Failure"
  Russian_Politics.23.d:0 "Following weeks of turmoil, the Russian government made the controversial decision to halt its investigation into the weapons thefts and high-ranking military conspiracy. Officially, Duma Investigative Committee cited a lack of actionable evidence and the need to "restore stability and avoid further division" within the Empire. Unofficially, whispers of political pressure and fears of provoking the military further drove the decision.\n\nHowever, just days after the investigation was shelved, disaster has struck. Communications between Saint Petersburg and much of the Empire were abruptly severed. Telegraph lines are dead, rail networks are not reporting in, and no radio signals from regional hubs are being received. Initial theories suggest sabotage or a catastrophic infrastructure failure, but the scale and precision of the disruption have raised fears of something far graver."
  Russian_Politics.23.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the garrison!"

  Russian_Politics.24.t:0 "March on Saint Petersburg"
  Russian_Politics.24.d:0 "The Moscow Circle, a clandestine group of ultranationalist military officers, has executed a bold and calculated coup in Saint Petersburg, the heart of the Russian Empire. Over the past 24 hours, they have stormed the capital, seizing key infrastructure, including communication centers, transportation hubs, and military garrisons. The city's streets have been filled with the sound of marching boots and mechanized rumbling as soldiers loyal to the Circle assert their dominance.\n\nThe coup plotters have arrested the Prime Minister and detained legislators, accusing them of failing to uphold the Empire’s strength and sovereignty. In a broadcast from the Winter Palace, the Circle’s leaders have declared the Duma dissolved, calling it an impediment to the nation’s unity. They have promised to restore order and greatness to the Empire, appealing to the ultranationalist fervor of his supporters.\n\nThe citizens of Saint Petersburg have been left in shock and fear as military patrols enforce a strict curfew and checkpoints appear throughout the city. Rumors of resistance have surfaced, but the Circle's swift and coordinated actions have silenced most opposition. The coup has plunged the Empire into uncertainty, with the Moscow Circle asserting control and reshaping the future of Russia under their iron rule."
  Russian_Politics.24.a:0 "The Duma concedes to the military."
  Russian_Politics.24.b:0 "Under public backlash, the military backs down."

  Russian_Politics.25.t:0 "Things in Motion"
  Russian_Politics.25.d:0 "The Moscow Circle's clandestine plot to overthrow the Russian government has been uncovered before it could fully unfold. Reports from loyalist officers and intercepted messages have revealed their plans to storm Saint Petersburg, seize the Duma, and arrest the Prime Minister. As authorities prepare to arrest key conspirators, the Circle has sprung into action preemptively, launching their coup with less preparation than intended.\n\nWithin hours, the coup plotters have taken control of the Duma, detaining members and establishing a defensive perimeter. However, they have been unable to secure full control of the city's communications infrastructure, leaving their actions exposed to the outside world. Loyalist forces remain active in parts of Saint Petersburg, and urgent messages have been transmitted to military units and provincial governors, sparking confusion and calls for a response.\n\nThe Prime Minister, confined to a secure location, has been confronted with an impossible decision. The plotters have demanded his surrender, promising to preserve his life and some semblance of order under their regime. Meanwhile, military advisors have urged him to authorize the shelling of the Duma to eliminate the conspirators. With the city on edge and the Empire's future hanging in the balance, the Prime Minister must decide whether to risk the chaos of resistance or capitulate to the Circle’s demands."

As news of their actions has spread, protests and demonstrations have erupted across the Empire, decrying the ultranationalists as traitors. Key members of the Circle have either been captured, killed, or forced into hiding, their plans shattered by the sheer scale of resistance from both the government and the population.\n\nDespite the successful operation to reclaim the Duma, the Russian Empire’s fragile democracy has suffered a grave blow. Public trust in the government has been shaken by the chaos and destruction, while debates over the use of military force against the coup plotters have deepened divisions within the Duma itself. Nonetheless, the democratic institutions have endured, signaling a commitment to restoring stability and preventing such a crisis from occurring again."

Backed by Tsarina Anna, they have pressured her to dissolve the Duma entirely and replace it with the Ecumenical Council, a body composed of clergy and loyalist officials. They argue that the recent coup and the Duma’s perceived inefficacy demonstrate the need for divine guidance and centralized control to stabilize the Empire.

As part of the closure, prisoners are being repatriated to various locations, with many being transferred to Russian America in mainland Alaska or relocated to other more centralized facilities within the Empire.\n\nA significant political challenge has emerged, however, due to the racial and ethnic motivations behind many of the prisoners' sentences. A large portion of the incarcerated population consists of individuals from minority groups, including those of Jewish ancestry, as well as various ethnic groups who have long faced discrimination within the Empire. The government has found itself divided over how to handle this sensitive issue.

Despite its’ shorter length, the piece details the extensive abuses of the Aleutian Complex in lurid detail. Bronstein writes of prisoners being subjected to weeks of solitary confinement, rampant abuses of power, and most damningly the abuses of staff in the women’s facilities. While our own records showed some abuses, Bronstein’s work suggests that even the central government was unaware of the depravity their own correctional staff participated in. Rape is noted as having become a borderline epidemic within the staff of the women’s facilities, much to the embarrassment of Saint Petersburg.\n\nThough many within the government believe Bronstein is exaggerating the abuses for political gain, we have nonetheless received significant backlash since the work was published.

The question now facing the Circle is who will be chosen to take the throne: Grand Duke Nikolai or Grand Duke Andrei.\n\nGrand Duke Nikolai, the first candidate, is seen as politically neutral and easily controlled. With his mild disposition and lack of strong ideological commitments, he would be a puppet figurehead, allowing the Moscow Circle’s leaders to wield true power behind the scenes. His selection would ensure stability in the short term, with few challenges to the Circle’s authority. However, some members of the Circle worry that Nikolai's lack of political influence could limit his ability to maintain the loyalty of the imperial court and military.\n\nOn the other hand, Grand Duke Andrei, the second candidate, currently serves as the Tsar of Zheltorossiya, the Russian Empire’s holdings in Manchuria. While Andrei’s leadership there has earned him respect, his selection would introduce complications. His strong nationalist views and established base of power in the Far East could challenge the Circle’s control, particularly if his ambitions extend beyond the throne of Russia.

One researcher, Doctor Mikhailova, became obsessed with the idea of manifesting a Tulpa—a conscious, autonomous entity created through sheer mental focus. Using the new technology, she attempted to bring her creation to life, delving deep into her subconscious in search of a being she could control.\n\nMikhailova vanished shortly after her experiment, leaving her quarters empty and disarrayed. The search for her proved fruitless, and it wasn't long before staff members began experiencing strange dreams. At first, it was just whispers of her name, but soon the dreams became more vivid, more real. Mikhailova appeared in their minds, guiding them through dark corridors of the complex, her voice hauntingly familiar.\n\nThe dreams became so frequent and unnerving that one researcher, affected by the visions, disappeared while on medical leave. With his disappearance, the staff started to panic. Those who had been touched by Mikhailova's presence started vanishing one by one, as if the dreams were calling them into the abyss. The line between the waking world and the dream realm blurred, and the remaining staff realized with dread that they might not be dealing with a creation of the mind, but something far more sinister.\n\nI can see you now. You dream just as we all do. When you rest, and you will, I'll be there. Waiting. Hungry."

Every conceivable aspect had been discussed, from projected profits to budget allocations and the choice of materials. Now, all they needed was the Tsar’s approval for such a massive undertaking.\n\nThe lilliputian bureaucrat who headed the committee, a man whose name the Tsar had long forgotten, seemed to drone on like an automaton for eternity on the trivial details of the pipeline.

The man of god hardly looked like the embodiment of Christ that the cult desperately tried to project and advertise. He had the stock of a Siberian peasant with filthy, unshaven facial hair that would have been scorned in St. Petersburg.

  Russian_Commonality.5.t:0 "Luddite Rebels Attack Infrastructure"
  Russian_Commonality.5.d:0 "Luddite rebels have launched a series of coordinated terrorist attacks against key Russian government facilities in retaliation for the implementation of the Commonality Consensus project. These attacks have targeted neural implant distribution centers, government communication hubs, and research facilities linked to the Consensus, resulting in significant damage and loss of life. The rebels have claimed responsibility through anonymous manifestos, condemning the project as a violation of human autonomy and a tool of authoritarian control. Their actions have disrupted the rollout of the Consensus in several regions, forcing the government to divert resources to counter-insurgency efforts.\n\nIn response, Russian authorities have increased security measures and declared a state of emergency in areas most affected by the attacks. Public sentiment has been divided, with some citizens sympathizing with the rebels’ concerns about privacy and individuality, while others view the attacks as dangerous and unjustified. The government has emphasized its commitment to the Consensus project, portraying the rebels as extremists opposed to progress. However, the escalation of violence has highlighted the growing rift between those embracing technological integration and those resisting it, raising questions about the long-term stability of the nation."

  Russian_Panopticon.1.d:0 "We've has begun the activation sequence for the National Panopticon, a modified and highly centralized version of the Commonality Consensus developed under the authority of the ruling military junta. This system has been designed to grant the junta unprecedented control over the thoughts and behaviors of the population, effectively merging individual consciousnesses into a monitored and regulated network. Official statements have framed the Panopticon as a necessary measure to ensure national security and social stability, though concerns about its ethical implications have persisted.\n\nAs the activation sequence has progressed, reports have emerged of mandatory neural implant upgrades in major cities, with citizens compelled to participate under threat of severe penalties. The Panopticon’s architects have claimed that the system will eliminate dissent and streamline governance, but critics have described it as a dystopian nightmare that erases personal autonomy. The project’s implementation has marked a chilling milestone in the junta’s consolidation of power, leaving the nation poised on the edge of a new and deeply uncertain era."

  Russian_Panopticon.2.d:0 "The National Panopticon has come online, successfully interfacing with the neural implants of millions across Russia. With its activation, the system has achieved the military junta’s vision of unprecedented control, monitoring and manipulating the thoughts of citizens in real time. Traitorous or subversive ideas have been identified and expunged on a neurological level, erasing dissent before it can manifest into action.\n\nThis technological milestone has solidified Russia as a permanent totalitarian state, where individual autonomy no longer exists, and loyalty to the regime has become a matter of enforced thought. The Panopticon has been heralded by its architects as the pinnacle of social order, while the few who dare to criticize it have either vanished or fallen silent, their thoughts reshaped by the very system they fear.\n\nThe nation now marches under an unyielding regime of absolute mental control."

These are cries that we can ignore no more. We must begin organizing the third meeting of the Provisional Duma, Here we will discuss several important issues, most notably the role of local regonalist Dumas.

  PB_RUS_Debate_on_Voting:0 "Debates on Voting Reform"
  PB_RUS_Debate_on_Voting_desc:0 "It has been clear for many years that the Duma is in an archaic state in its current form. The Tsar still holds an influential position in government thanks to the royal veto, with critics labelling the Duma as simply a ‘House of suggestion’. As such, it is imperative that we restrain the monarch’s powers and reform the system into a much more democratic constitutional monarchy by empowering the Duma.\n\nThis naturally includes revising our administrative structure, with many proposals already having been submitted. The two most popular options presented are that of a regionalist or centralised Duma. The former, favoured by the liberal voices in government, aims to enfranchise minorities by granting more autonomy and power to regional representatives. The latter, supported by the more conservative minds, calls for a centralised top-down approach with power consolidated within Moscow and therefore the ethnic Russian majority. The Duma shall be left to debate on which policy of reform to follow, let us see what Russia’s future holds."

This will allow power to be more efficiently handled from the capital and will give more power to the Russian Majority in the country. Our more liberal detractors argue that this is intended to reduce the power of ethnic minorities within Russia.

Though mostly frozen tundra, it has plenty of space for our industrialsation programme. However, Sibera has little in the way of large transportation networks.

However, as we work on modernizing our economy, we have an important issue to fix as quickly as we can. That issue is the decentralization of the Russian economy, a thing of the past that puts strain on our efforts.\n\nWe can no longer abide such a hamper on our work.

However, with the success of our economic plan, we have taken a scalpel to the gangrenous wounds and cut away the worst of the rot.\n\nWith the reshuffling of officials and greater oversight, Russia finally begins to reap the rewards of its 1732 investment.

Beyond such absurd thoughts of importing corn to Ukraine, the agricultural question has remained unanswered.\n\nEnter Nikolai Vavilov.\n\nDriven by the famines that tormented his family, Vavilov dedicated his life to eradicating famine and crop failure. A pioneer in the field of genetics, Vavilov is a fierce critic of Trofim Lysenko and takes a distinctly Mendelian approach to agriculture.

Area Zero is not a place to be concerned with questions of ethics or morality. We are here to answer a series of vital and practical questions, before providing answers to said questions. While we can get all the funding needed, our biggest obstacle is time. If we are to deliver results, we must be as quick and efficiently as possible.

Known by its creators as ‘Project Solaris,’ the first-of-a-kind planetary flyby would be the first spacecraft to escape the confines of Earth’s gravitational field and rendezvous with another planet.\n\nSolaris aims to study the chemical properties of Venera’s outer sphere of gravitational influence. The probe will be flung at an inclined descent, providing it a closeup look at Venus while providing the velocity it needs to fling out of the Venusian sphere of gravitational influence. Utilizing this velocity, the probe will reenter Earth’s atmosphere and land in the Pacific Ocean.

As urban centers begin to grow exponentially in the Far East, the far-flung distances from agricultural centers in Ukraine has cropped the need to plow sheets of permafrost. Enter, Project Zona.\n\nThis ambitious biochemical program, straight from the brightest minds in Moscow, has found a trail blazing method to apply genetic modification into crops already grown in chilly climates, such as winter wheat and carrots, to flourish under sub-arctic weather. Initial results from Yakutsk have proven highly fruitful, and in order to expand agricultural production in our eastern territories, it is imperative that we invest into this project.

Mixing an addition of fibrillation implants and synthetic biochemical enzymes, Project Autojektor’s designs emphasize blood loss and cardiac resurrection. Upon experiencing massive blood loss and/or death, fibrillation systems will goad myocardium to restart blood flow, and specially grown volumes of enzymes will accelerate the infilling of cracked veins to mere minutes. While the technology is not pristine, it’s a leap closer to vanquishing the grim reaper, and implementing it into our armed forces will be perfect to solve manpower issues on the frontline."

With a system of implants and monitors, we could use the network to regularly scan citizen's thought patterns for anti-state beliefs, which could then be corrected with a broadcasted counter-pattern. A minimally invasive model would allow us to, with relatively little effort, rapidly condition the population to be more passive and supportive of the regime, eventually §Rwithout them even realizing it.§!"

  PB_RUS_Okhrana_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe so-called §YFirst National Awakening§! ended in the defeat of the nationalist forces, yet for many the wars of independence never ended. Across the Ukraine, Poland, the Baltics, and Finland nationalist forces continue to struggle against Russian rule. Combating this is the §YDepartment for Protecting the Public Security and Order§!, colloquially known as the §YOkhrana§! or Guard Department. Previously just the state security apparatus of the Empire, the Okhrana was expanded dramatically following the Nationalist Rebellions to combat the remnant rebel forces.\n\nThe Okhrana is reliant on resources provided §Ymonthly§! and by gathering §Cintel§!; these resources must be used carefully to target and eliminate key figures in the secessionist movements to reduce their power. Additional §Ymonthly resources§! can be acquired by expanding Okhrana operations centers; however these will require a large initial investment before becoming operational.\n\nOur goal is the §rdecapitation§! of rebel leadership, however eliminating leaders of rebel factions may drive them in different ideological directions and lead to other figures assuming command of the movement. A rebel group is §Yonly§! fully defeated once §Yall§! the most noteworthy members of their leadership are liquidated.\n\nIf the Okhrana fails to control the power of a rebel group, there may be §rdrastic§! consequences if they perceive us to be weak or distracted.\n\nHover over button to get §YHelp§!\n\nCurrently, the Okhrana has access to £RUS_Okhrana_Resources §G[?RUS.RUS_Okhrana_Resources]§!

That promise cannot be utilized in our current Siberia, as the vastness of the land is simultaneously a boon and a curse. Siberia's infrastructure is lacking, the population consists of illiterate peasants and its villages house little to no economic activity or potential. Radical transformation is necessary. \n\nThe §YSiberian Plan§! charts the problems and issues of the area with the intention of bringing economic civilization to this wasteland in the near future. Across the European part of the Russian Empire, engineers, chemists, architects, officers and bureaucrats are shipped to work in the Siberian wilds.

The proposal has thus been to give form to an entity with the goal of harvesting the gold deposits of the Far North in the form of the Far North Construction Company, headed by famed geologist Yuri Bilibin and under the management of the secret police and the interior ministry. \n\nThe mandate of the FNCC is clear: the extraction of valueable minerals from Northern Siberia. Under this mandate, the FNCC has the clearance to construct and operate the logistics and transport of the area, monitor its infrastructure and secure valueable labour pools from the Katorga colonies.

This caused the Russian government to begin to invest in the region, albeit half-heartedly as a result of the vast distance between the heartland of Russia and their colony. Such a distance convinced the government in Saint Petersburg to leave Alaska to control itself while Russia focused elsewhere, and in 1880, the "Russian America Reorganization Act" was enacted, reorganizing Alaska into the "United Colonies of Russian America", officializing its autonomy within the Russian Empire.\n\nThis has been the status quo until recently, when in 1927, the Vilkitsky Oil Basin, one of the largest such basins in North America, was discovered in the North Slope. The Alaskan economy skyrocketed as local companies and megacorporations began scrambling northwards in order to set up infrastructure to access the oil. However, the amount of oil that has been extracted from the basin has not been meaningful enough to allow the state of affairs to continue. As such, the Russian government has finally decided to place its stake in the Alaskan oil industry and has authorized the construction of a great singular pipeline, the Trans-American Pipeline, in order to begin effectively extracting the oil out of the remote basin and to the coast for usage within Russia proper.\n\nConditions are incredibly difficult due to Alaska's general nature, but that will not stop us from finishing our work and finally being able to completely tap into the great and vast wealth within Alaska's core and exploit its potential to the fullest.\n\nProgress of the §YTrans-American Pipeline§! - [?RUS.PB_RUS_Trans_Alaskan_Pipeline_var|%G]"

Once both phases are complete, the National Panopticon can be brought online and begin churning data for the government.\n\n[RUS_get_panopticon_text]"
