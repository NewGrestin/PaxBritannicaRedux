  GER_Country_Desc_Topbar: "§YFeatures:§!\n    - Unite Europa under one banner\n    - Manage the state of Federation\n    - Continue the fight in exile\n    - Maintain Germany's vast empire\n    - Become a continental European hegemon\n    - Set Germany on a path of economic greatness\n\n§YSituation:§!\nThe Empire of Germany is the preeminent continental power in Europe in 1933.\n\nEmerging from their defeat in the §YFirst Franco German War§!, the Holy Roman Empire found itself in a state of flux. Wracked by the liberal revolutions following the §YFrench Reformation§!, many within the Empires Habsburg hegemon feared complete dissolution. Others, however, like Emperor Francis II, saw the defeat as an opportunity. The peoples of Germany had been defeated once, and they would never be defeated again.\n\nThis began the period known as the §YWars of Consolidation§!. Either through agreement or arms, Austria and her allies began the ardous process of centralizing and reforming the Empire. This period of conflict would come to a head with the §YAustro-Prussian War§!. Offering territorial concessions in Poland to Russia in exchange for their assistance, Austria invaded and strangled the nascent Prussian superpower in the crib. With the back of the Hohenzollerns broken, Austria turned her attentions West to Alsace-Lorraine. The §YSecond Franco German War§! saw the Germans avenge their defeat in 1797 and in a lavish ceremony in Versailles, Franz Joseph I was crowned as the first Kaiser of the German Empire.\n\nThis state of affairs proved too much for Austrias own constituencies in Hungary and Illyria, who demanded self-determination from the new German state. The §Y1870 Ausgleich Treaty§! saw Hungary gain independence in all but name, while Austrias southern Slavic provinces were reorganized into the §YDinaric Federation§! as a Dominion of Germany. This state of affairs proved unsustainable with the outbreak of the §YGreat War§!. As Germany fought brutal trench warfare across Flanders and Wallonia, their Hungarian allies collapsed into revolution while the Dinaric Federation broke free in the fervor of Slavic ultranationalism that gripped the Balkans.\n\nThough a victor in the war, Germany decisively lost the peace. The §YLong Depression§!, the postwar collapse of the European economies, fermented political unrest of all kinds. Germanys former Russian ally has gone sour and blames the German hegemon for their postwar decline. Even worse, the resurgent and revanchist French state is seemingly on a collision course for war once more. Only iron and blood will see Germany through these dark days.\n\n$PB_special_thanks$\n\n"

Much of the Kaiserins early life is unremarkable, having received very little interest from Empress Elisabeth of Germany, who reportedly detested her status as a grandmother. The Kaiserins education and upringing were similarly standard for a member of the Austrian Royal Family, though she would rebuff pressures from her Father to marry the Hohenzollern crown prince, an incident that would strain tensions between the two families.\n\nFollowing the death of Franz Joseph and the accession of Rudolf to the throne, the Archduchess would take a more prominent role in Austrian politics. Most notably she openly endorsed the post-war socialist governments and offered her support to the womens suffrage movement in Austria. Now, imbued with the powers of the sovereign, the \"Red Kaiserin\" can push her agenda of reform."

  ### Leader Descriptions
  GER_Franz_Ferdinand_Desc:0 "Emperor of Austria, Emperor of the United Kingdoms of Germany, King of Bohemia, Apostolic King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Lodomeria and of Illyria, King of Jerusalem and so forth. Archduke of Austria, Duchess of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola, Margrave in Moravia, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n§YBorn:§! 18/12/1863\n\nFormer Archduke Franz Ferdinand, now §YFerdinand§!, Emperor of all Germans and German imperial possessions, was born as the cousin of former Emperor Rudolf III and was thus not far down the line to inherit the German crown. Yet, as long as Rudolfs daughter, Elisabeth, was alive, Ferdinand didn't bet highly on his odds of becoming Germanys monarch. Large parts of his early life were thus spent hunting and travelling, mounting the most exotic of animals on the palace walls as his tactical achievements, as hunting was not far removed from the realities of modern warfare. Ranging from kangeroos and alligators to elephants and a priced albino gorilla, the heads decorating the walls are lined up like a timeline, detailing Ferdinands greatest exploits.\n\nWhile the archduke enjoyed his hunting expeditions across the mystical continents of Asia, Africa and Oceania, sometimes nearly wounding himself during the process, tension brewed after the death of Rudolf III. Elisabeths political leanings terrified the upper echelons of German society, which was able to mobilise a significant portion of voters during the last election, kicking the UDP out of power in favour of the ultraconservative DV. As the conflict between Elisabeth and the new government grew, decisions needed to be made. A telegram from van den Bruck changed history, placing the giddy Ferdinand on the throne of a German Empire.\n\nNow, the many animals of Konopiště Castle have been moved into Weilburg Palace, the private residency of Emperor Ferdinand, gifted to him by the Hessian administration after his ascension to the throne. There, he monitors the situation somewhat approvingly, giving a carte blanche to the DV and its imperial ambitions, yet, due to his absolutist tendencies, remains stubborn in his pragmatically pacifist views. No irresponsible war shall be started during his reign.\n\nBut what is an "irresponsible war" really?"


  POLITICS_KARL_DONITZ_DESC:0 ""The North German does not go in for extremes. He has broader horizons than the men from the mountains of Bavaria and Austria."\n\n§YBorn:§!16/9/1891\n\nKarl Dönitz earned his glory, in the Great War he served in the German Navy like no other sailor could show. He is efficient, ruthless and seems to feel not a bit of pressure. At the end of the war he became of Germanys Greatest War Heroes. He continued to serve in the Navy gaining prestige and ranks through his persistance on continuous development of Naval Technology and Doctrines. With his rising tensions in the recent years in the Pacific the now Admiral Dönitz was dispatched as Statthalter to the Pacific Commonwealth. There he hopefully shall root out rising internal resistance and shield the colonies from foreign aggression.\n\nHowever if we look under the facade of Admiral Dönitz we might learn more about what a man he truly is."

  # IDEAS
  ##########################
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression:0 "The Long Depression"
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression_desc:0 "The interwar years have not been kind to the German Empire. The failed colonialist policies and foreign policy blunders of the Ludendorf government, combined with the immediate economic crash after the end of hostilities in 1910, contributed a general depression across the entire continent. This lead to political instability throughout the Empire, driving away foreign investment and forcing Germany to lean on their internal industries and colonies to survive. This has lead to a Germany dramatically weakened and produced an unheard of 13% unemployment rate, with poverty running rampant."
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock:0 "Bundestag Gridlock"
  PB_GER_Political_Gridlock_desc:0 "The ongoing economic crisis has fermented gridlock throughout the Empires primary legislative body, the Bundestag. The divides between the leftist labour movements and the conservative right have deepened dramatically, preventing meaningful legislative solutions to Germanys myriad of political problems."
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism:0 "Prussian Separatism"
  PB_GER_Prussian_Separatism_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Prussian Kingdom during the Wars of Austrian Consolidation, the Easternmost territories of the Empire remain the most rebellious. Eastern Germany and Prussia remain a hotbed of ultranationalist sentiments, with the Prussian Freikorps, or Free Corps, a constant problem with the local authorities. These hyper-reactionary militias frequently come into conflict with both the police and leftist political leaders, leading Eastern Germany to gain a reputation for being unstable and dangerous."
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor:0 "Enough Dead Heroes for the End of Time"
  PB_GER_Great_War_Victor_desc:0 "Germany stood among the victors of the Great War, further cementing the nation as one of the preeminent world powers and finally breaking the perfidious Bourbons. Yet, more than a decade later many are still war weary. Germany suffered tremendous losses throughout the war, with millions laying down their lives in the trenches of Flanders and Alsace to achieve victory. Germany took their place in the sun, but for many, there are enough dead heroes buried in Flanders' fields for the end of time."

The question now is whether we want to forgive the French people for all they have caused. We believe we SHOULD forgive them, they caused the war, they killed our heroic soldiers. The French people should however not pay for the actions their government did. They should be forgivven, and be brought with us together into a new era of peace in which they can actively enroll in international politics and in international trade by our side.

But since we now stand victorious once more, we do not wish to disband the famed Legion, but rather add to it by creating the French-German legion. Its purpose will be basically the same as the French one, but will also consider German interests, and will have a German commander from time to time. As there is now peace in Europe we have decided to rebrand it as an interventionist force for colonial wars, rather than a real legion for a real war. And just like the French one, we won't only be accepting German and French citizens into it, but also all others who wish to join or who we ask to join it."

And especially on the topic of the Imperial Province of Alsace-Lorraine we have decided that in order to ensure peace, the French government will be forced to give up their claim on the province of Alsace-Lorraine, and that they will never try to claim the land again or fight a war for it. This agreement will be known as the Eternal Treaty of Strasbourg to make sure they can never break it."

Now that all of that and more has been achieved, we believe it is time to say goodbye to the old borders of Europe, the old idea of the nation state, it is time to establish a great European nation in peace and without conflict. Europe may be the cause of much death, of much destruction, but together we have achieved more than any one man can dream of. What is an ocean without a wave, a city without a street, they are different things, yet they go to together and live in harmony."
  
  PB_GER_Rudolf_Crisis:0 "The Abdication Crisis"
  PB_GER_Rudolf_Crisis_desc:0 "Today, the unthinkable has happened. Kaiser Rudolf III has announced that effective immediately, he will abdicate the throne. In his old age, His Majesty feels that he can no longer properly execute the duties of the throne and the throne will soon pass to his only child, Princess Elisabeth. Though this alone would not be a great crisis for our country, the unstable nature of this all has caused Gustav Streseman and his cabinet to resign. Per the German constitution, fresh elections must be held soon to form a new government, even as the political situation has become increasingly polarized without Rudolfs guiding hand at the helm. It seems the months ahead will be a time of chaos."
  PB_GER_New_Elections:0 "Elections"
  PB_GER_New_Elections_desc:0 "With Stresemans government having resigned, the time has now come for the German people to elect a new government. Though more minor parties do exist, the next government will likely be formed by one of the three major parties in Germany. The socialist SB commands a great deal of support from the working class, and promises a program of extensive reform to increase workers rights, centralize the nation, and nationalize key industries. The Liberals in the UDP hope to provide a progressive future for Germany, prosposing economic liberalization, massive reforms to the ducation system, and new measures to improve our military and fight extremists. Finally, the arch-conservative DV promises to fight against degenerate modernism, create a world-class army and war economy, and strengthen the power of the government. The elections are predicted to be close, and whoever emerges victorious will certainly do so by the skin of their teeth. Only God knows what the future has in store for Germany."

The Sozialistischerbund promises a radical new path for Germany, one where the worker need not fear their boss and where all Germans will stand as proud equals. Already, our plans for nationalizing major industries and expanding workers' rights have won over the suport of millions. Though the road ahead will be a difficult and dangerous one, it is the belief of every member of the SB, from the lowliest worker to allegedly the Kaiserin herself that Bismarcks legacy will be realized in full. Long Live Socialism! "

  PB_GER_Kaiser_Elizabeth_desc:0 "Since taking the throne, Kaiserin Elisabeth has openly supported many charitable causes, including more rights for workers, suffrage for women, and better living and working conditions for the German poor. Gaining her support will be a valuable asset not only in increasing our control of the government but spreading our message to the German people as well. Though much of the aristocracy may be angered by  our new ideas, the support of Her Majesty will hopefully be enough to keep them from getting any...undemocratic ideas."

The SB strongly supports the Parliamentary System and will stand for protecting the civil liberties of all Germans. Those radicals in our ranks that would support Republicanism, armed revolution, or even Jacobinism are a threat not only to our partys unity and legitimacy, but to the entire German nation. We will disavow these extremists and make sure that not a single one may call themselves a member of the SB."

  PB_GER_Rights_of_Workers_desc:0 "For too long, the economy has served the profits of a few wealthy individuals over the working masses. Millions of Germans toil in the factories for hours upon end, facing hard work and hazardous conditions for so little pay they cannot afford to make ends meet. This state of affairs should offend any decent man. We will prepare a set of sweeping labor laws to protect the rights of workers to organize and strike, set a minimum wage, and provide state pensions for the sick, retired, and infirm. From now on, Germany will put people before profits, and the Capitalist Class will learn to accept this state of affairs if they want to keep their greedy pockets full."

  PB_GER_Limit_Church_Power_desc:0 "Germany is by and large a deeply Christian nation. The northern states were the home of the Protestant Reformation, while our ruling monarchy descends from Holy Roman emperors crowned by the Pope himself. Unfortunately, the Church and its institutions limit the glorious potential of the German people, holding back our plans for reform and social progress. Just as Bismarck desired during his time, we shall fight a \"Kulturkampf\" against the Churchs power and institutions, paving the way for a modern and secular Germany. The people will be our God."
  PB_GER_National_Recovery_Programm:0 "The Programm of National Recovery"
  PB_GER_National_Recovery_Programm_desc:0 "The economic situation in Germany leaves...much to be desired to say the least. Unemployment is by some estimates over 10 percent. Inflation is rampant. Bankrupt businesses shutter their doors. Though the Right will certainly decry the great cost of what must be done, we know that the German people need immediate relief before the economy gets any worse. A sum totalling over two billion Kroner will be spent on emergency handouts, bailing out failing banks and businesses, and increasing the size and scope of our budding welfare system. In addition, an extensive Public Works program will be created to provide work for the unemployed masses and improve the nations infrastructure, power generation, and industries."
  PB_GER_Nationalization_Industry:0 "Rightful Nationalization"
  PB_GER_Nationalization_Industry_desc:0 "The German working class continue to toil for a tiny ruling class that cares little for their interests or the interests of Germany. These Fat-Cat Capitalists do nothing but line their own pockets with the blood, sweat, and tears of millions of German workers while prices rise and wages fall, worsening the rampant inequality and economic woes seen nationwide. Pursuant to our agenda of creating a fair, equal, and socialist Germany, corporations operating in key industries will be nationalized and wages increased across the board. Notably, this plan will include the total nationalization of assets in areas such as rail, electric power, utilities, banking, armament industries, mining, and many other crucial elements of the German economy."
  PB_GER_Tragic_Rearmament:0 "Facing Reality"
  PB_GER_Tragic_Rearmament_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our desire for peace in Europe is threatened by enemies across the continent. The Revanchists in France plot and scheme to get revenge against our victory in the Great War and reverse the gains of our hard=won victories. Already, they have rearmed in contravention of post-war treaties and gathered allies to prepare for their intended destruction of Germany. Even worse, our old allies in Russia have seemingly turned against us -- angered by their minimal gains in the Great War for an enormous cost in life, they have allied with the Prussian extremists and are poised to invade us from the East.\n\n Sadly, our plans for peaceful development and pan-European cooperation must be put on hold. New economic developments will be focused on the rapid rearmament of the German army, increased mobilization, and the extension of conscription until the European crisis ends. If Europe were to plunge into total war once more, the German nation must be ready. We will be victorious, or we will certainly perish in the flames of revenge."
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Unify_States:0 "Equality among the German States"
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Unify_States_desc:0 "Since the foundation of the United Kingdoms of Germany, Austria and her Catholic Sister States in Upper Germany have dominated the German federation. Because of this, development has been largely focused in Austria and her periphery, while the northern regions of Germany have been left in the dust. Some SB leaders from Brandenburg and Lower Saxony have proposed a new amendment to the Constitution that will give all German states equal representation in the Reichsrat, hopefully allowing for the development of a stronger and more equal Germany."
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Centralization:0 "Continue Centralization"
  PB_GER_German_Federation_Centralization_desc:0 "Centralization is a dirty word in German politics. Having been a hot button issue since the day we unified, Germans are deeply divided when it comes to how exactly to organize the federation. That being said, much to the chagrin of local rulers, the SB has always favored a program of centralizing the state and reducing the traditional powers of the German states. Though we certainly respect ethnic and cultural autonomy, as the German people are a diverse nation, we cannot allow for outdated administrative borders and petty princes to stand in the way of our plans for Germany. Increased centralization will lead to more administrative efficency, a less bloated and corrupt bureaucracy, increased tax revenues, and the curbing of local monarchs who have often ruled with autocratic powers."
  PB_GER_German_Free_Phillipines:0 "Loosen our Grip on the Phillipines"
  PB_GER_German_Free_Phillipines_desc:0 "Since our conquest of the Philippine Islands, our supposed crown jewel of the German colonial empire has served as little more than a glorified naval base. The local populace are neglected, left to work in slave-like conditions while Germans back home are fed racist propaganda about the supposed civilizing mission of the Imperial Government against the \"Yellow Savages\". Ultimately, the Philippines have not only shown the very worst side of Germany in our treatment of the indigenous populace, but have been wholly unprofitable, as whatever revenue we extract from the islands is spent on keeping down the numerous Jacobin revolutionaries. It is time that we end this tragic expedition and begin negotiations with leaders of the Filipino nationalists on how we can change the situation in the archipelogo."

With threats from France, Russia, and beyond looming, we cannot let tradition stand in the way of protecting the Fatherland.

Jews will formally be given the rights to practice their religion without impediment and guaranteed equal rights and treament before the law.

Bismarck would be proud to see what we have accomplished so far, but our next step would have made him even prouder. To demonstrate just how far-reaching our political revolution has become, the SB, with the approval of the Kaiserin, has proposed declaring that from now on, the United Kingdoms of Germany shall be known as the German Federation.

Though some might criticize our measures as ironically rather socialistic, we know that only the strong hand of the state can save us from socialism and poverty. Firstly, we must institute a provisional hike in taxation across the board in order to pay off our debts and ensure we can balance the budget for a more sound economic future. Sccondly, the Economic Ministry will be given additional powers to provide economic stimulus to expanding businesses, forging a strong alliance with the capitalist class even as we institute many elements of a planned economy, albeit temporarily.

With our recent innovations in military technology and doctrine, Rommel has sought to perfect the Bewegungskrieg once and for all.

  germany.1.t:0 "The Kaisers New Years Address"
  germany.1.d:0 "As the new year begins, celebrations throughout Germany have begun to peeter out. Early in the morning, Kaiser Rudolf III appeared before a gathered crowd in Frankfurt to deliver his new years address. His speech contained little in terms of tangible promises to the people, keeping in line with his generally apolitical stance, but of particular note was his consistent references to the need for \" more modern leadership for the Empire.\"\n\nThese cues, coupled with the Kaisers general withdrawal from public life, has lead to concerns among the nobility of weakness. Though the Kaiser has rebuffed any concerns from his advisors to the contrary, it has become something of an open secret that the Kaiser has sought retirement from his position for some time. The Kaisers retreat from publicity has lead to greater indirect power being vested in the hands of the Autonomous Kingdoms, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria supposedly mocking the Kaiser as \"feminine and weak\" for focusing more on his family life.\n\nRegardless, the government does not run on rumors, and Chancellor Stresemann believes that he can finally push his reform plan through the Bundestag this year."
  germany.1.a:0 "Perhaps 1933 will finally be our year..."

  germany.2.t:0 "Bread Riots in the Rhineland"
  germany.2.d:0 "Political violence is not unheard of in Germany, and almost a decade of economic downturn has lead to many instances of rioting. In Koblenz, however, a series of bread riots rapidly got out of control, leading to nearly twenty five deaths and dozens of injured.\n\nRelief efforts in the Rhineland have been ongoing for the last year due to crop failures, and the region continues to suffer from one of the nations higher poverty rates. According to witnesses, bread being distributed in a poorer neighborhood of Koblenz escalated into violence when bread supplies began to run out. After being denied their ration, reportedly several men assaulted the relief workers before being shot by the police. In the ensuing chaos, four police officers were tackled and beaten while relief offices were ransacked.\n\nMinister-President Goebbels has sent a furious letter to the offices of Frankfurt, demanding the deployment of the Nationalgarde to Koblenz."
  germany.2.a:0 "Goebbels is a hysteric. Absolutely not..."
  germany.2.b:0 "I suppose we could spare some reservists..."

  germany.3.t:0 "The Kaiser calls on Stresemann"
  germany.3.d:0 "Stresemann met with the Kaiser earlier this morning over lunch, and returned to his office visibly shaken. When questioned, he stated that the Kaiser confided in him that he planned to abdicate the throne. According to the Chancellor, the Kaiser was open that the stress of rule and his advancing age had begun to severely affect his health.\n\nHis statements are not without merit, Stresemann stated, as the Kaiser had been hospitalized in 1930 following a bout of pneumonia. Though the incident was largely kept out of the papers, the event had \"made his majesty acutely aware of his mortality.\"\n\nThough there are no legitimate concerns regarding succession, Stresemann believes that the abdication is \"exactly the kind of chaotic mess we can't afford right now.\""
  germany.3.a:0 "...Oh."

  germany.4.t:0 "Kaiser Rudolf Abdicates the Throne"
  germany.4.d:0 "When the news reached the people, most did not know to respond.\nConfused? Sad? "Fearful of the Future?\n\nWhen was the last time a Kaiser Abdicated? Did it ever happen? Now people were remembering one important detail surrounding all of this. The Kaiser had only one heir, his daughter Elisabeth Marie.\n\nA woman. After 250 Years a woman would again come to bear the title of Kaiser. However everyone knew she would not become the next Maria Theresa. While personal friends often give her the nickname of 'Erzsi', the public and especially her greatest doubters call her the'Red Princess'. Elisabeth has made some years ago pubibly that she believes in the values of socialism, peace and unity. Despite being forbidden to join a party, she has several contacts and friends in the labour party and she herself organized food banks for poor people during this depression.\n\nDespite protests of several politicians, Rudolf insisted that she would suceed him as Kaiserin. And so when all Germans were able to see the coronation of their new Kaiserin on television, it is not unfounded to say that they had the same thoughts in those moments.\n\n What will happen now?"

  germany.5.t:0 "Prince Georg claims the German Throne"
  germany.5.d:0 "Though most Germans are at the very least acquiescent to Kaiserin Elisabeths ascension to the throne, not all are willing to accept a woman at the head of the German state. The most vocal opposition to the new monarch is from Prince Georg, who insists that not only is Elisabeth wholly incapable of ruling, but that a woman has no place on the throne at all. Normally, such a statement would be considered outright sedition, but to the horror of many left-leaning politicians, a large segment of the right-wing parties in the Bundestag have stood behind his claim. Their concerns largely stem not from shared sentiments of misogyny but from Elisabeths openly left-wing rhetoric. Though by law, members of the Royal Family are forbidden from joining any political party or holding elected office, this has not stopped Her Majesty from calling for socialist reforms and trying to present herself as an \"Empress of the People\".\n\n Though this has earned her the love of the working class, the conservative coalition led by the DV in the Bundestag is vehemently opposed to such statements from the throne. Elisabeths reign may turn out very short indeed depending on how the Bundestag votes on the matter of Prince Georges claim."

  germany.7.t:0 "The Hirschfeld Institute"
  germany.7.d:0 "The political and social upheaval of the interwar years produced a vibrant community of theorists in Germany. Of particular note was Magnus Hirschfeld, a leading figure in sexual studies. Born in Kolberg, Brandenburg-Prussia, Hirschfeld spent the interwar years pioneering his research of alternative sexuality.\n\nHirschfeld’s most notable work in recent years has been his advocacy for the concept of “spectrum sexuality.” Spectrum Sexuality argues for the idea of gender and sexual preference as a fluid concept and independent of one-another, going against the traditional sexology studies on the subject. In addition to this, Hirschfeld has been a prominent advocate of homosexual rights throughout Germany, often butting heads with more conservatively minded politicians. Up until recently, the Hirschfeld Institute of Sexual Studies has been funded by private investors, however now Hirschfeld himself has approached the German government to seek official support."

  germany.19.t:0 "A Murder in Vienna"
  germany.19.d:0 "Shots rang out in the city center of Vienna this afternoon as an unidentified, strangely dressed man suddenly fired on another at a cafe. Before the stranger could escape, he was apprehended by the local police and taken in for questioning. The man he targeted, 44 year old local Adolf Hiedler, died from his wounds shortly after the attack. Hiedler, a local painter in the Vienna Artist Commune, served a brief term of service in the Reichsheer before being forced to retire due to wounds suffered from a French gas attack\n\nThe unidentified stranger, who spoke with an abnormal German dialect, explained frantically about \"going to the wrong timeline\" and showed investigators a series of photos of what appeared to be people behind barbed wire and some kind of large mushroom-shaped explosion. When it was explained that he would be indicted for murder, the man claimed he \"shouldn't have rounded up his calculations\" before gunning down the two interviewing officers with a hidden automatic pistol and escaping the police station. Police were unable to find where the man had escaped to, but did find that he had left a leather jacket with a few personal affects.\n\nAmong the strangers possessions was a small black device with a plastic exterior and a button that would open it to reveal a key. Several buttons on the top would cause a small red light to flash as well. The items were handed off to Evidenzburo officials the following day, who plan to continue investigating the bizarre murder."

  germany.22.t:0 "Frankfurt has Fallen"
  germany.22.d:0 "When France attacked, many within our military feared defeat, right now it seems as though those fears are being realised.\n\nFrench forces entered the capital not long ago, our military assets within the city held them off as long as they could, but it did not last. The invaders managed to prevent any reinforcements by taking the roads and railway links immediately. Without any kind of relief, the city was doomed.\n\nFortunately, most of the government ministers had been evacuated days ago, so our government remains largely intact. And civilians within the city are organising resistance against the French occupation. But even as we draft plans to retake the city, this is without a doubt a major blow to our war effort."
  germany.22.a:0 "Re-establish a temporary capital in Munich"

  germany.23.t:0 "Munich has Fallen"
  germany.23.d:0 "The situation grows even direr every day.\n\nDespite the best efforts of our military, it seems the French advance cannot be stopped. Our already battered armies that stood in Munich’s defence were completely routed. Their divisions moved swiftly through any breach in the line and exploited it. Despite its easily defensible position, the city itself fell with little fighting. As most of its defensive garrison has either been redirected elsewhere or was already destroyed.\n\nWith Munich’s loss, we must have the possibility of fleeing Germany as the military situation is becoming increasingly untenable. Diplomatic overtures and requests for exile have already been made to other nations, as a contingency if our colonies fall too. Even some of the more idealistic of our military and population are seeing the writing on the walls.\n\nIf we don’t turn this around soon, Germany will fall."

In this case the blood of an influential Liberal politician Frans Schroeter, he was shot this morning at 7 o’clock when walking past the University to a nearby bakery. The assassin has been caught by the local police, and is believed to be a radical who opposes the current German government. After the police took a glance at his past records, he has been arrested for petty crimes and has spent time in a mental facility near Munich, where he was released a few weeks prior, from which he returned to his home town of Wurzburg, and made the decision sadly some people had to witness.\n\nThe police have also said that they believe he wasn’t acting alone, and that this action was not just because of his illness, they believe someone talked him into doing this, however there is not yet any evidence to support this claim. Witnesses say that not even the Great War compares to the way Mr. Schroeter was murdered, so brutal, so toughtless and so inhumane. It has been rumoured that a kid present during the murder was watching it happen, and hasn’t left his room since then.\n\n The local government is deciding whether to bring the man to justice or whether to hang him because of his crimes, no choice will seem to be made anytime soon. The public is firmly against justice, and wants his head off, maybe even with a public execution, however from the local government no response has yet to come to this idea. As a response to this the German national government has announced plans to oppress and damage the radical parties even more, anti-French sentiment is also rising as people are starting to speculate they were behind the assisination.

In the next hours special mortar teams, armored cars and even flamethrowers arrived on the scene. The Second Battle was over quickly with the complete destruction of the Czech Legions.\n\nWhile some elements of the Legion might have gone underground the leadership decided to fight until the bitter end. Josef Šnejdárek personally fought with his machine gun until he was burned alive by a Flammenwerfer Unit. Some politicians are already showing some kind of regret for this kind of bloody battle.

And then, the Chancellor began his response:\n\n“Honourable and noble members of this Diet, you have heard very...colourful terms used in response to one of our most recent pieces of legislation, talk of spies and conspiracy amongst the Jewish population of our nation, especially from the right honourable Hugenberg. But I come to you requesting a chance to speak and offer my perspective on our nation’s actions. And fortunately I have been granted an opportunity to do so.\n\nMany of those who do not approve of the actions of our government claim that Jews are traitors, thieves, with more than a few of them disputing their very humanity, along with their citizenship and the status of this land as their home. You call us traitors and cowards, but ignore our sacrifices during the war. Hundreds if not thousands of Jews volunteered, giving life and limb for Germany. You claim we have taken our money, while it is Jewish businesses that contribute to our economy. And you say that Germany is not our land, that there is no greater honour than driving us out. But we have lived here for centuries, long before any of you were born. Even in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, my people were here; we have earned our place in Germany.\n\nYou claim that such beliefs and practices are noble, but where is the honour in driving away honest hard working people who sacrificed everything for a country that berates them! That does everything they can to fix our ailing economy, just as any other German would! All while you ignore the storm clouds forming over Europe, the Revanchism of France grows as it eyes to absorb our territory. If you truly cared for Germany, you would see the real threat rather than chasing make believe boogeymen who only exist in your imagination! Bring us together, instead of dividing us apart.”\n\nThe ministers and politicians cheered, waving the flags of Germany, celebrating this speech as a victory in itself. Over the tide of anti-semitism, as Rathenau looked out to the crowd, he could see the quiet fury of Hungenberg, he knew this would be an uphill battle. But this was a start."

The city miraculously avoided any major urban firefights or long drawn out sieges thanks to the mayors willingness to surrender the French garrison in the city without much of a fight. The location was decided upon after the both the German and British government had jointly decided that Paris was simply not suitable to host any form of official conference, let alone one that would decide the fate of the many war criminals that had come about during the war. Parisian infrastructure was virtually none existent and both parties quickly decided that the largely intact Lyon would suit the conference best, with the court hearings and procceedings being held within the once defunct parliament house.\n\nThe first matter of the Trials was the topic of the SP and their role in the war. Many disturbing atrocities, especially towards jews, had taken place under SP leadership and whilst the investigation into some of the worst of these atrocities are sill on going the verdict had been made clear by the court; death by hanging for those responsible for crimes against humanity. The next topic of discussion was that of the French and Russian military, numerous violations of the rules of war were broken on many occasions by important individuals originating from the armed forces of these nations and it can be argued that such individuals were responsible for Frances warmongering attitude. The court decided on a case by case basis and many high ranking military officials had either received the death penalty or life imprisonment. The final discussion point of the day was that of the individuals who held government jobs and the country leaders themselves. Both economists under the French and Russian government utilised slavery in different forms to full their war machines. They were also complacent in the mistreatement of prisoners of war as well as occupied populations and arguably encouraged it. These government officials mostly got away from having the death penalty besides some extreme cases. Finally was the topic of the leaders of France and Russia. This was the most long and drawn out area of the Lyon Trials and lawyers on either side passionately argued that both parties were responsible for the enviroment that lead these nations to the path of war, they also pointed out the hypocrisy in the British and German empires who had achieved their world status by conquering other nations much in the same vein as the French and Russian governments. However the court did not budge and came to the conclusion that both leaders were to be hanged and their bodies cremated in undisclosed locations. By the end of the week the trials had concluded and most of the individuals responsible for the horrors of the Second Great War were either dead or locked up indefinitely. Europe must now rebuild itself, piece by piece, and undo the mistakes of the past else it face the monster of vengeance once again."

  germany_exile.1.t:0 "Our Darkest Hour"
  germany_exile.1.d:0 ""A day will come when sacred Troy shall perish, and Priam and his people shall be slain." Scipio to his Greek mentor Polybius after the defeat of Carthage.\n\nIt is written in history that all empires will come to an end, that all things good are inherently mortal, our empire being one such thing. Frankfurt now mimics that of a descrated corpse, once beautiful and plump it now rots with a foul stench. Waiting for someone to bury it in the dirt never to be seen again. The French may either be our grave digger, or a mere passer-by, whatever the case may be one thing for sure is that we are far from home, if we can still remember what home is. With our armies beaten and our people hungry we must fight hard and die well, for there is no other choice for a dead man to do."
  germany_exile.1.a:0 "We will return to the Fatherland, no matter the cost"

  germany_exile.2.t:0 "Germany offers us an alliance"
  germany_exile.2.d:0 "The Imperial German government, now forced into exile as we were by the Fatimist fanatics, have approached us with an offer of alliance. This would almost certainly be in our mutual interest. Both our nations have now been forced out from their homelands, and some in our army and government have become demoralized from the belief that we may never see our home again. Were we to accept this offer, the extensive fleets and resources of the German government-in-exile would be at our full disposal for the destruction of our mutual enemies.\n\n How shall we answer?"
  germany_exile.2.a:0 "I see no reason why we shouldn't accept"

  germany_exile.3.t:0 "Portugal accepts our proposal"
  germany_exile.3.d:0 "The Portuguese exiles have reviewed our request for an alliance and have decided to accept it on the common grounds that both nations wish to return to their homelands Though there was some concern the Portuguse may refuse, given concerns of security, their government-in-exile has made the wise choice to stand with us and work together to return to our rightful homelands. Perhaps there may be hope for liberation yet."
  germany_exile.3.a:0 "Fantastic news!"

  germany_exile.4.t:0 "Germany demands our submission"
  germany_exile.4.d:0 "The German government-in-exile has demanded that we allow for the unification of our two countries. They have threatened military intervention into our territory if we do not comply. Though perhaps most countries would respond to such a demand with a resolute \"no,\" our nation was founded by German settlers and many Sudwestafrikans still view Germany as our Mother Country. Rather than face an unecessary war with our brothers, it seems the pragmatic option would be to at last rejoin our German brothers and help them liberate the Fatherland."
  germany_exile.4.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"

  germany_exile.5.t:0 "Sudwestafrika bends the knee"
  germany_exile.5.d:0 "Sudwestafrika has accepted our demands, citing that they always wished to return back to Germany. Their dire sitaution may be some cause of concern, especially for our already struggling economy but analysts believe the effects would only be minor. What matters is that we have reunited these brave settlers with their Fatherland, even if home may seem impossibly far from us."
  germany_exile.5.a:0 "Their masters have returned"

  germany_exile.6.t:0 "Germany demands our submission"
  germany_exile.6.d:0 "The German government-in-exile has demanded that we submit to their authority without delay. If we were to refuse, it is near certain that the German Army-in-exile would make quick work of us. Though weakened by their exile, they still have a powerful navy that could pound us into dust. Naturally, it seems that there is little alternative to contacting the German ambassador and making it clear we have no intentions of refusing their demands."
  germany_exile.6.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"

  germany_exile.7.t:0 "The Dutch fold"
  germany_exile.7.d:0 "The Dutch government has reluctantly accepted our demands of submission. They have made their position clear however that this occupation must be temporary and if it isn't then armed conflict would arise. Regardless, the government is ecstatic. The acquisition of Dutch territory shall surely be a great boon to our efforts against those that occupy the Fatherland."
  germany_exile.7.a:0 "As they should"

  germany_exile.8.t:0 "Liberation Until Death"
  germany_exile.8.d:0 "The deformed Parisian creation that was Nuremburg Germany has collapsed following the defeat of France and we have rightfully reclaimed what is ours."
  germany_exile.8.a:0 "Our nation is ruined, but from that ruin we shall arise stronger than ever before"

  germany.666.d:0 "This is it. This is most likely the end of your game. I hope you had fun with the United Kingdoms of Germany and Bugs did not ruin your experience.\n\nMaybe you will not even see this event but nonetheless, I want to express my thanks to everyone who helped me on Germany.\n\nThere is Weis, propably the best GFX Artist I know in this community. He helped me early when I started working here and his icons are just beautiful. With every single day that passed the quality of his icons just became better and better. Thank you Weis.\n\nI want to thank every localisation writer who helped me write focus descriptions, events or decisions. English is not my main language and writing long complicated texts has always put my modding on a pause. But thanks to you guys, we were able to give lore and life to Germany. Thank you Silent King, Tapir, Erwin, Soble and Mimi.\n\nI want to thank everyone who helped with coding. May you be from the development team or the Mod Coop, you always helped me with the tedious Hoi4 Code. I was able to advance my modding skills thanks to you and hope that I will learn lot more in the future. Thank you Bernie, Grestin, Stallone, Fausi, Nilo, Zero, Two Wat and so many others.\n\nWe all supported and helped each other so we could be able to release this mod. I want to thank so many more like Boring for his 3D Model Expertise, the Music Guys, the people who made me laugh and so many more but we would reach the limit of the event space.\n\nLastly I want to experess my own gratitude to be able to work on this mod. I have worked on several Hoi4 mods in the past but this is the first one where I really felt like that there was a vision for the setting. That there was a genuine desire to create fun gameplay for the players. And that there is such a great development team. Thank you Grestin and Bernie for accepting my application.\nThis is the first time I worked on major country on modding, including making custom mechanics. I had to learn new things, bear a lot of responsibility and experience several pushbacks but in the end it is finished. Pax is finally coming back.\n\nAnd of course.\nMy greatest thanks is to you. The player who decided to play this mod we all worked on. I hope you have a great day.\n\n\n- Lofn"
