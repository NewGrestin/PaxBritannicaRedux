  PB_Iberia_Annihilated:0 "Scars of the Iberian Campaign"
  PB_Iberia_Annihilated_desc:0 "The Invasion of Iberia by the Imperial Powers during the Great War was, indisputably, one of the most destructive events in the history of the region. While the Iberian Campaign remains a traumatic memory to Anglo-American troops across the pond, the people of Iberia continue to experience it acutely every day. More than a decade on from the war, Northern Spain remains a blasted hellscape outside the Basque region, with Livewire infestation and chemical residue leaving whole tracts of land uninhabitable.\n\nThe trauma of the Invasion and Occupation weighs heavy on the civilian population, who suffered from Zeppelin terror bombings and reprisals by British troops, who were often demoralized by Spanish resistance attacks. Though efforts have been made to re-establish control over the North, the Spanish government still maintains a series of large exclusion zones around Great War battlefields."
  PB_POR_Home_of_Fatima:0 "Home of the Fátima Revolution"
  PB_POR_Home_of_Fatima_desc:0 "In October of 1917, three children in Portugal claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary, who delivered unto them many prophecies of the future to come. Few at the time could have prophecized the events that came after. The people of Portugal, deeply traumatized by their firsthand experiences of the Great War, took a strange fascination in the Fátima Event. Little by little, the seeds of a religious revolution began to take hold.\n\nThe Royalists chose to support the new League of Fátima, seeing them as little more than a pawn in the postwar political scene. The Fátimists knew better, however, and they understood that the horror of the Great War was but the first seal on the road to Armageddon. The people of Portugal had been denied the love of their creator for far too long, and the radicalized masses of god soon began to rally around Sister Lúcia of Fátima, though some thought a mere child was a poor choice for the face of such a movement.\n\nEvents spiraled out of control as the European economy spiraled and Fátimist control grew, culminating in the submission of the so-called Twelve Demands, chief among which was a demand that King Luis II abdicate his throne in favor of the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth. The Royalists rose up against the movement, but were quickly overthrown and a new heavenly kingdom proclaimed. Emulations of the revolution broke out in Spain, but with remarkably less success. Portugal will be a kingdom of god, and of god alone, and it shall §Rprepare for the blowing of the next trumpet.§!"
  PB_POR_Appalling_Recognition:0 "Appalling Recognition"
  PB_POR_Appalling_Recognition_desc:0 "The Divine Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia is, at least internationally, a rogue state. Too radical for London or Frankfurt, hated by Madrid, and only tacitly supported by the Papacy. With the Royalist government in the former colonies continuing to lobby against and undermine our recognition, our avenues of trade are extremely limited."
  PB_SPR_Mongrel_State:0 "Disorderly Orders"
  PB_SPR_Mongrel_State_desc:0 "The Holy Order of Spain is, at best, little more than a coalition of military warlords, ultranationalists and monarchists with the veneer of Catholic fundamentalism. While the Fátimists in Portugal remain semi-unified, the Spanish government is perpetually divided among the various Crusader Orders, whose allegiance to the cause is middling at best. Until a single faction can take power over this controlled anarchy, Spain will continue to remain a borderline failed state."
  PB_SPR_Civil_War_Aftermath:0 "A Century of Humiliation"
  PB_SPR_Civil_War_Aftermath_desc:0 "The contemporary history of Spain could best be described as a perpetual catastrophe. The first revolution in 1808 and the French intervention, the collapse of the empire in the Americas, and the Great War took Spain from a world power to barely even a local one. In the last thirty years, Spain has experienced at least one revolution, two military coups, and a civil war in the waning years of the Great War.\n\nThe rise of the Holy Military Orders, largely as a response to the Fátima Revolution, ended whatever semblance of democracy Spain had. Spain has experienced almost nonstop humiliation and defeat, and many wish to see it reclaim its' position in the world."
