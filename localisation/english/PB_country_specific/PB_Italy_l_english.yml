  PB_IST_Last_Leg:0 "Last Leg"
  PB_IST_Last_Leg_desc:0 "The Italian civil war has been a long conflict. Many men have died. Many guns have failed their users. Many boys have been sacrificed for the greatness of Italy. All is in vain. \n\nWe have been cornered into Savoy by the Italian army, our cause lost in the eyes of those loyal and those opposed. We're on our last leg now and it will only take a swift kick to the knee for us to fall."

  PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio:0 "Treaty of Anzio"
  PB_ITA_treaty_of_anzio_desc:0 "While Italy did support the Entente at the end of the war, it was always clear that this loyalty was forced upon Italy through Entente pressure. Thus, Italy had to pay for their crimes against the winning powers of Europe and for joining the Bourbon-alliance against the Entente powers. However, due to Italy’s support in the later years of the war, the great powers actively decided to not unreasonably punish Italy, like they did with France. Instead, Italy was forced to demobilize its army and put future restrictions upon its army, such as restricting the use of chemical warfare and experimental tank warfare. The Italian navy and airforce also were decreased due to the treaty and Italy had to pay a small amount to the winning powers. \n\nWhile the treaty has only been a political issue with the ANI gaining its main succes from opposing the entire concept of the Anzio treaty, the civil war has turned it into a bigger issue, with Italy starting the conflict without a proper army. Eventual agreements have given way to loosening the rules of Anzio, allowing Italy to combat the current neo-imperialist splinter with an armed force."

  PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence:0 "Unstable Young Democracy"
  PB_ITA_Considerable_Political_Violence_desc:0 "Despite adopting some liberal and progressive ideas of democracy and liberalism prior to the Great War, Italy's experience with democracy has been limited at best, hindered by the previous absolutist tendencies of the monarchy and the surpression of liberalism under the previous regime. However, the Great War left the Italian people without any faith in the traditional system and the old monarch resigned, leaving Gerdinand III to handle the aftermath. Combined with the general distrust of the Bourbons post-war in the UK and Germany and it became a recipe for governmental and societal change. Italy, if it liked it or not, would be dragged towards democracy by the allied powers, despite its kicking and screaming. \n\nWith the establishment of Italian democracy in 1912 and the PLI coming to power, Italian society would experience extensive changes. The wind of liberalism swept across the country: young women ditched conservative clothing for more fashionable and slightly revealing options, young men went against the grain and listened to British and German jazz and a fair few cities even became hotbeds of these new age ideas. Experimentalism regarding politics, identity and sexuality are palpable in Rome, Pisa and other big cities, showing the societal changes that have occured with our new democracy, something some celebrate and others detest. \n\nHowever, young democracy is never stable. The late 20s and the economic stagnation of the era turned the people sour. As unemployment grew, so did extremism. The growing blueshirt movement on one end of the spectrum and the jacobin movement on the other, Italy would turn into a battlefield between these two extremes. Paramilitary groups of many jacobin, socialist, nationalist and imperialist groups dominated the streets for years. Violence would soon turn to treason and the ANI, with the support of the French, staged a violent coup d'état in 1929, kickstarting the Italian Civil War. \n\nViolence has characterized our younger years, but perhaps it's time to grow up and confront these demons."

  PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery:0 "The War Crawl"
  PB_ITA_Slow_Recovery_desc:0 "Italy has only recently unified under the rule of the Bourbons and, is thus, quite agrarian compared to other European powers. Where the British, French and Germans heavily invested to industrialize as fast as possible, Italy had to deal with others problems surrounding the economy, such as the fuedal-style relations between farmers and landlords and other inefficencies in the agricultural system. Industrialization only started slowly in the early 20th century, only to be hindered by the eventual Great War and the vast economic consequences this war would have. \n\nDespite its agricultural nature, Italy was able to musture a force equal to the other European powers and fight on almost equal footings to them. However, compared to France, Britain and Germany, Italy would continue to feel the economic and financial consequences of the war deep into the 30s, with a vast government debt, many young men killed in the war and infrastructure in a relatively bad state. Vast reforms would follow the rule of the PLI with the liberalization of the market, leading to an increasingly bad position for the agricultural sector. In 1933, the economy is still crawling towards recovery with many farmers either leaving their farms for the city or leaving Italy altogether for the New World, hoping to find a new way of life there. Untill active measures are taken, Italy will continue to suffer under the heavy problems left by the war."

PB_Soldier_Pope:0 "Soldier Pope"
TISSERANT_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 24/3/1884 \n\nBorn Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant, the new pope Pius XI is one of the first non-Italian popes in recent memory, born in the city of Nancy and studying theology in that very same city. An eager student of almost anything, Tisserant is fluent in Amharic, Arabic, Akkadian, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Persian, Russian and Syriac. It is perhaps through his linguistic skills that he was given the roll of intelligence officer in the French army during the first Great War. \n\nWhile a French patriot through and through, Tisserant now stays in the Vatican as the world outside has changed significantly. France's devolution into ultranationalistic totalitarianism was especially heart-breaking to the new pope, who has since then given refuge to multiple French anti-government intellectuals in Rome. As the pick of the more liberal faction of cardinals in the Vatican, Pius XI is expected to be a serious departure from the more stable rule of Benedict XVI's compromise. A pope so staunchly anti-totalitarian and with experience in war, Pius XI promises to be a fresh change in the Holy See."
CLEMENT_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 31/5/1885 \n\nBorn in the Austrian city of Graz, Alois Karl Hudal's German nationality would help him gain a position in the Anima during Benedict XVI, as the pope sought to preserve German dominance of the institution instead of letting it fall in Dutch or Belgian hands. From his position in the Anima, Hudal would go on to become one of the largest proponents of the French system of national chauvinism inside the Catholic Church, with his magnum opus \"The Foundations of Moral Nationalism\" approving of Doriot, D'Annunzio and other nationalists and their commitment to the Church. He's also a big proponent of anti-semetic conspiracies, applauding Doriot's policies regarding the Jewish and Protestant populations of France. \n\nHis vocal support for these kinds of regimes has split the cardinals. While a large selection of anti-revolutionary cardinals picked the new Clement XV, the more liberal faction of cardinals heavily oppose his appointement. They have failed to stop Hudal's selection as the next pope. \n\nThe Catholic Church is about to find itself in rocky waters in the coming decade and it is unclear if Hudal will keep the ship afloat or if he will personally help it to the bottom of the sea."

flavournews.1.d:0 "With the recent death of Pope Benedict XVI emptying his holy seat in the Vatican, the papal conclave of [GetYear] has come together and agreed upon a new pope. Despite the differences among the cardinals on the details of doctrine and what kind of personality the next pope should be, a decision was made to appoint Eugène Tisserant, a relatively new cardinal. \n\nPicking the papal name of Pius, Pius XI will be the first French pope since Gregory XI in 1370. Pius XI is also an extraordinary pope in his politics, as, while a French patriot, Pius has consistently opposed the Doriot regime and has helped anti-government intellectuals before becoming pope."

flavournews.2.d:0 "With the recent death of Pope Benedict XVI emptying his holy seat in the Vatican, the papal conclave of [GetYear] has come together and agreed upon a new pope. Recent times have seriously split the Church, however, as the eventual pick of German bishop Alois Hudal was marked with controversy. \n\nThe new Pope Clement XV is mainly controversial for his views on Doriot and D'Annunzio, being a staunch proponent of their new way of government. Clement XV has written essays on the matter, often describing the men as defenders of Christianity against foreign forces. His anti-semetism has also marked the new pope as a problematic candidate."
