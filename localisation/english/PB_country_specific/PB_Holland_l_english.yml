 PB_NI_Dutch_Mercantilism: "Dutch Mercantilism"
 PB_HOL_flanders_fields: "In Flanders Fields, The Poppies Blow"
 PB_HOL_flanders_fields_desc: "The south of the country has remained ruined since the end of the Great War, with entire villages still left barren and old battlefields scarring the landscape. The psyche of Flanders too is scarred; with countless widows mourning both husband and son, while the younger generations retreat into crime and cheap pleasures to escape from the war’s lingering shadow."
 PB_HOL_sapphire_revolution: "Echoes Of The Sapphire Revolution"
 PB_HOL_sapphire_revolution_desc: "When the waves of reformation and revolution swept Europe in the last century we too were not left untouched. Following France’s adoption of liberalism the House of Orange found itself challenged by the radical Patriotten; with them demanding an end to the hereditary statholderate and the return to true republican values.\n\nThe so-called “§RPatriottentijd§!” continued until 1795 when a string of riots and subsequent crackdowns led to their violent seizure of Amsterdam. In a bid for peace the Kingdom of France intervened to save the republic from anarchy, hoping to prevent the ambitions of its own radicals by snuffing out the Dutch Jacobins and instituting the aristocratic “§CSapphire Revolution§!”. Although the statholderate was abolished among these reforms, the dreams of the Patriotten were crushed as the French reinforced the old oligarchy that was hoped to be overturned.\n\nNow over a hundred years later the same calls for change are being echoed by a new generation of radicals. Riots flood the streets as the people grow uncontrollably restless, having grown impatient by our government’s reluctance to democratise. We can only hope to weather the storm at this point."
 PB_ORJ_lesotho_resistance: "Sesotho Resistance"
 PB_ORJ_lesotho_resistance_desc: "Ever since we settled in this region the Sesotho peoples have resisted our existence and no agreement has ever been able to be established between us and the Sesotho peoples, thus we are in conflict until one of the two sides is defeated or leaves."
