  albania.1.t:0 "Conducting a Census"
  albania.1.d:0 "Our officers have come to us with dreadful news, after doing a census of our military, it appears as if we are missing men. Across our airforce, navy and army it appears as if one thousand, three hundred, and twenty one soldiers are gone! This is a massive stain on our international reputation, and a failure that will surely cost some commanders their head! We will rectify this immediately!"
  albania.1.a:0 "Gone with the wind?!"
