  albania.1.t:0 "Conducting a Census"
  albania.1.d:0 "Our officers have come to us with dreadful news, after doing a census of our military, it appears as if we are missing men. Across our airforce, navy and army it appears as if one thousand, three hundred, and twenty one soldiers are gone! This is a massive stain on our international reputation, and a failure that will surely cost some commanders their head! We will rectify this immediately!"
  albania.1.a:0 "Gone with the wind?!"

  PB_ALB_Navy_Autocracy_Support_desc:0 "Currently our navy is outdated and outclassed, Our Admirality suggests we allow foreign advisors to advance us into the modern age."

  PB_ALB_Army_Jacobin_Support:0 "The More The Merrier"
  PB_ALB_Army_Jacobin_Support_desc:0 "Our Army is uh, notably light on men, lowering standards for conscription should solve the issue, but experts warn it would allow Jacobins in our army, but who ever listened to the experts?"
  PB_ALB_Army_Autocracy_Support:0 "No Country For Old Men"
  PB_ALB_Army_Autocracy_Support_desc:0 "Conscripting more men? We could.... But who needs more men when can make our current men better! How? Dont ask questions you dont want answers to, back to work Private!"
