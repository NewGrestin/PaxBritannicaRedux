  PB_Idea_DAS_Fleet_East:0 "The German Fleet in the East"
  PB_Idea_DAS_Fleet_East_desc:0 "We are the German Fleet in the East. \n\nEverything in between the Arafura Sea and the Luzon Strait is our domain. Among theses waters, our prerogatives are limitless and our reputation well established. Although the British persist in seeing us as a second-class navy, our success in supporting counter-insurgency operations across East Asia has forced them to reconsider our strength on numerous occasions. \n\nIronically enough, London might see us under a better light than our own government does. Nevertheless, if the socialist bastards may howl against Dönitz and the fleet's “humongous” budget, Vienna knows very well it needs us around to keep the oversea colonies afloat. \n\nAs Germany's ugly daughter, our armada does not have the luxury to fail and start anew. Either we win or else we shall succumb to Vienna's political bickering."
