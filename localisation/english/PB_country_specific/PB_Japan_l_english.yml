  PB_JAP_Republican_Terror_Legacy_desc:0 "The Purges that followed Japan’s revolution still torment many in the Republic, and thousands still remain imprisoned. Hashimoto’s regime has divided much of the Japanese populace, with some seeing him as their protector against reactionaries and others seeing him as little better than the Emperor."

  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_desc:0 "	Whispers abound in smokey back rooms of a society dedicated to a return to the revolutionary principles that Hashimoto betrayed. Formed of an alliance of disenchanted lefitsts, this so-called Cherry Blossom Society seeks to overthrow the Hashimoto government and create a more democratic Japan."

  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_Plot:0 "The Secret War"
  PB_JAP_Sakurakai_Plot_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that reactionaries are now operating in Japan and attempting to undo the Revolution we fought so hard to achieve. The assassination attempt on Kingoro Hashimoto, Grand Protector of the Japanese Revolution, has revealed the hand of these perfidious forces. If we are to preserve the Japanese way of life and our Republic, these forces must be eliminated.\n\nThe Current Plot Power of the Sakurakai is at §Y[?JAP.Sakurakai_Plot_Power]%§!\n\nThe Current Level of Suspicion against the Sakurakai is at §Y[?JAP.Sakurakai_Suspicion]%§!\n\n[GET_ISHII_STATUS]\n\n[GET_NAGANO_STATUS]\n\n[GET_NOSAKA_STATUS]\n\n[GET_OKAWA_STATUS]\n\n§YThe Coup will happen at the conclusion of the timer. In order to succeed, the Coup's Plot Power must be above 50% and Suspicion below 50%, and any pro-Hardliner individuals in the government must be eliminated. In order to prevent the coup, Plot Power must be below 50% or Suspicion must be above 50% and all pro-reformist individuals must be removed. Failing to remove certain individuals if the coup is successful may have consequences.§!\n"

  repjap.10.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER Backed into a corner by the overwhelming Sakurakai forces, Hashimoto refuses to relinquish power and commits suicide.

  repjap.10.a:0 "We must safeguard the Pan-Asian ideal"

  repjap.11.t:0 "The People's Shogun reigns Triumphant"
  repjap.11.d:0 "Some called Kingoro Hashimoto a madman, others called him a traitor, but now anyone who would say otherwise had been swept away. His reign secured, Hashimoto stands atop a throne bathed in the blood of reactionaries. Japan would never again be allowed to fall into the perfidious grasp of imperial reformists or republicans.\n\nThese and many more thoughts drifted through his mind as he watched the bloodshed from the balcony of the Revolutionary Directory. The last remnants of the Sakurakai, the bastard Oyama and his anarchist whore, were lined up alongside dozens of others. He hardly remembered who most of them were, that was Ishii's job after all, he just signed the lists.\n\nThere was no ceremony for the traitors, and methodically, almost rhythmically, the guards moved down the line. After a time, the thud of the pistol began to sound like a drum beat. A drum beat that would guide the heart of his new Japan. He had been to kind to the people, too soft, but never again would that be allowed to happen. The final pistol crack gave him a clarity he had not had since the flames of rebellion brought down the Imperial Palace. Japan was an iron bar laid across the anvil, heated by the fire of revolution and the Grand Protector...\n\nHe was the hammer."
  repjap.11.a:0 "Death solves all problems."

  repjap.12.t:0 "The Righteous Crusade"
  repjap.12.d:0 "The joke is that it's bushido code but being twisted to make people kill each other with ideological fanatacism lmao"
  repjap.12.a:0 "Excellent work, comrades."

  repjap.13.t:0 "The Gifts of Benevolence"
  repjap.13.d:0 "Hashimoto grants the military extra rations as a reward for hunting down and killing reactionaries, what a madlad"
  repjap.13.a:0 "Truly our rule is just."

  repjap.14.t:0 "The Value of Respect"
  repjap.14.d:0 "The Soldiers are taught to respect one another enough to willingly rat each other out for talk against the regime"
  repjap.14.a:0 "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, as the Americans say."

  repjap.15.t:0 "A Culture of Honesty"
  repjap.15.d:0 "Soldiers are actively encouraged to ensure the honesty of the masses though campaigns of terror"
  repjap.15.d:0 "Honesty is the best policy."

  repjap.16.t:0 "New Recruits"
  repjap.16.d:0 "With the liberalization of gender norms, even women, once previously consigned to traditional roles, can partake in the revolution. Although, Hashimoto thought to himself, perhaps not quite to this extent. The training runs for the newly formed women's brigade were in full force, and the Grand Protector himself had arrived to oversee the fruits of his reforms.\n\nA brigade's worth of women, some as old as their forties, marched in lock step around Tokyo's empty parade grounds while others trained with rifles or bayonets. Hashimoto was less than impressed, most of the recruits were far too young or too old for frontline combat. Perhaps Ishii had been right when he protested the reforms to begin with-\n\nHis train of thought derailed at the sound of someone sceaming like a banshee. Glancing up, he caught a blur of a woman tackling one of the training instructors. The mock fight, training for close combat, ended within seconds as the woman held a mock knife to her instructor's throat. Realizing she was beneath the gaze of Japan's Generalissimo, she dropped the knife and quickly bowed. Hashimoto laughed, rose from his chair and stepped down on to the parade ground, gesturing for the woman to approach.\n\n\"You'll go a long way with that kind of enthusiasm,\" he joked, A hand clasped on her shoulder. \"Your name, comrade?\""
  repjap.16.a:0 "\"Sada, sir, Sada Abe\""

  repjap.17.t:0 "The Midnight Phone Call"
  repjap.17.d:0 "Ishii, having grown his power through Hashimoto's reforms, seizes the chance to take control of Japan and forces Hashimoto to resign and commit suicide, framing it as a reactionary assassination."
  repjap.17.a:0 "The Shogun's finest pupil finally takes the throne"

  repjap.18.t:0 "The Midnight Phone Call"
  repjap.18.d:0 "Ishii attempts to seize control of the government, but understimates Hashimoto's control over the Revolutionary Guard and is subsequently purged, paving the way for Hashimoto's permanent absolute rule."

  repjapflavor.1.t:0 "A Quiet Shift"
  repjapflavor.1.d:0 "The days spent at what remained of the Imperial Palace were often quiet. When fires swept through Tokyo during the Glorious Revolution, the Palace was not spared. Some still remembered as Emperor Meiji himself stood before the burning wreckage of his legacy, the angry and starving wretches that once thought him a god closing in with rifles in hand.\n\nThese were quiet days though, Shirou thought. The Palace still remained a burnt out sepulchre, but the government insisted on guarding it lest it become a haven for \"Imperial loyalists." As he marched along the perimeter, his eyes fell on a young man standing near the gate, gazing absentmindedly at the blackened structure. A frown crawled on to Shirou's face as he stepped up to the man, barking orders.\n\n\"What are you doing here, this is a restricted area!\"\n\nThe man broke from his stupor, fixing his glasses on his face and sputtering an apology. He glanced back one last time at the Palace, then to Shirou, and smiled.\n\n\"I used to live here, you know?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nBefore he had time to respond, the man was gone, melted away into the bustling Tokyo crowd. Shirou shook his head, looking once more back at the Palace before moving on with his shift."
  repjapflavor.1.a:0 "\"What a strange man.\""
