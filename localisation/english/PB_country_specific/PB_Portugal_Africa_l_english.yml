  PB_Luis_II_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 21/03/1887\n\nBorn as §YLuís Filipe Maria Carlos Amélio Fernando Víctor Manuel António Lourenço Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga Xavier Francisco de Assis Bento§!, in Lisbon as the elder son of Carlos I. In 1907, the Prince Royal acted as regent of the kingdom while his father was outside the country. The same year he made a very successful official visit to the Portuguese colonies in Africa, the first member of the royal family ever to visit them and a dark sign where his life would lead him. On 1 February 1908, Luís Filipe and his family were returning to Lisbon two members of a revolutionary Jacobin society would shot at all the royal family, hitting his father King Carlos, Luís Filipe, and his younger brother Infante Manuel. Carlos I died immediately, while Luís Filipe and his brother would survive. This event would leave Luis a bitter man and lead to massive suppressions of any Jacobin or Democratic support. Later in that year he would join the Imperial Powers in the Great War and join their military campaign in Portugal which would result in Portugal gaining Galicia in 1909.\n\nThroughout the postwar-political scene Luis II would try to squash any democratic movements using all options available to him and therefore chose to support the New League of §RFátima§! seeing them as a counterbalance to Republican Movements. This would become Luis II greatest mistake as in 1923 the now powerful §RFátima§! would submit the 'Twelve Demands' demanding his abdication. Despite resisting the popular uprising the Royalists would be forced to flee the mainland for the Colonies. Over the following decades Luis II would launch several uprising or invasions in support of the monarchy in his homeland with the assistance of Britain and Germany. However all attempts would fail and Luis Philippe was forced to spend the last years in Luanda. With the old treasury drying up and unconstrained foreign support shrinking the Royalists would begin to lose more and more control over the Pink Colony in Africa. Over the last years Luis would be forced to negotiate with local leaders, putting down more and more native rebellions in the hinterlands and gave up territory for assistance. Luis II has lost most will to fight believing he has failed the Braganza Dynasty and is increaslingy isolating himself in his weakened state."
