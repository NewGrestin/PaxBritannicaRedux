  PB_DAF_International_African_Association_DAF_Fake:0 "The International Association for the Civilization of Africa was founded in 1885 shortly after the Frankfurt Conference. As European powers carved further and further into the deepest recesses of Africa, a loose coalition of entrepreneurs, businessmen and royalty began meeting in Vienna to discuss the ongoing issue of African barbarism. It was from this fateful meeting that the International Association for the Civilization of Africa was formed, soon gaining the support of the so-called 'big four', Great Britain, France, Germany and Portugal.\n\nWith international funding, the Association established outposts throughout nearly every African colony on the continent, from Casablanca to Natalia. In the years since their establishment, the IACA has been a major driving force in increasing African literacy, spreading christianity, and providing jobs to the local population. To many, the IACA is a shining beacon of the wonders of European imperialism, as well as a vindication of the so-called 'white man's burden'."

In the years since their establishment, the IACA has degenerated into what can best be described as a mega-corporate entity.\n\nSince the Great War, they have operated with legal impunity in the darkest jungles of the continent, bringing unimaginable suffering in their wake. Funding for what was percieved as a civilizing mission now goes towards mercenaries, gun smuggling, the illegal ivory trade and slave labour. Mass killings, rape, kidnappings, forced assimilation, child soldiers, very little is seen as beneath the IACA's overseers, who rule their outposts like petty barons of old. With Europe's eyes largely focused on the continent, few have been able to get the word out of the rampant atrocities of the IACA, and even fewer have been able to do so without facing ridicule or legal action.\n\nThe IACA has fingers in the pies of many an African colony, but their atrocities and incredible corruption cannot go unseen much longer."
