  GER_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YFeatures:§!\n    - Unite Europa under one banner\n    - Manage the state of Federation\n    - Continue the fight in exile\n    - Maintain Germanys vast empire\n    - Become a continental European hegemon\n    - Set Germany on a path of economic greatness\n\n§YSituation:§!\nThe Empire of Germany is the preeminent continental power in Europe in 1933.\n\nEmerging from their defeat in the §YFirst Franco German War§!, the Holy Roman Empire found itself in a state of flux. Wracked by the liberal revolutions following the §YFrench Reformation§!, many within the Empires Habsburg hegemon feared complete dissolution. Others, however, like Emperor Francis II, saw the defeat as an opportunity. The peoples of Germany had been defeated once, and they would never be defeated again.\n\nThis began the period known as the §YWars of Consolidation§!. Either through agreement or arms, Austria and her allies began the ardous process of centralizing and reforming the Empire. This period of conflict would come to a head with the §YAustro-Prussian War§!. Offering territorial concessions in Poland to Russia in exchange for their assistance, Austria invaded and strangled the nascent Prussian superpower in the crib. With the back of the Hohenzollerns broken, Austria turned her attentions West to Alsace-Lorraine. The §YSecond Franco German War§! saw the Germans avenge their defeat in 1797 and in a lavish ceremony in Versailles, Franz Joseph I was crowned as the first Kaiser of the German Empire.\n\nThis state of affairs proved too much for Austrias own constituencies in Hungary and Illyria, who demanded self-determination from the new German state. The §Y1870 Ausgleich Treaty§! saw Hungary gain independence in all but name, while Austrias southern Slavic provinces were reorganized into the §YDinaric Federation§! as a Dominion of Germany. This state of affairs proved unsustainable with the outbreak of the §YGreat War§!. As Germany fought brutal trench warfare across Flanders and Wallonia, their Hungarian allies collapsed into revolution while the Dinaric Federation broke free in the fervor of Slavic ultranationalism that gripped the Balkans.\n\nThough a victor in the war, Germany decisively lost the peace. The §YLong Depression§!, the postwar collapse of the European economies, fermented political unrest of all kinds. Germanys former Russian ally has gone sour and blames the German hegemon for their postwar decline. Even worse, the resurgent and revanchist French state is seemingly on a collision course for war once more. Only iron and blood will see Germany through these dark days.\n\n§YSpecial thanks to§!:\nBernie, Stallone, Lofn, Two-Watt, Wolfxe, Nilo, Mimi, Globus, Alfred/Fausi, BoringIndividual, Jubs, Tapir, Weis, Erwin, Jackie, Beezlebub, Zerogamer, SilentKing, Soble, Red, and Arj.\n\n"

  ### Leader Descriptions
  GER_Franz_Ferdinand_Desc:0 "Emperor of Austria, Emperor of the United Kingdoms of Germany, King of Bohemia, Apostolic King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Lodomeria and of Illyria, King of Jerusalem and so forth. Archduke of Austria, Duchess of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola, Margrave in Moravia, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n§YBorn:§! 18/12/1863\n\nFormer Archduke Franz Ferdinand, now §YFerdinand§!, Emperor of all Germans and German imperial possessions, was born as the cousin of former Emperor Rudolf II and was thus not far down the line to inherit the German crown. Yet, as long as Rudolfs daughter, Elisabeth, was alive, Ferdinand didn't bet highly on his odds of becoming Germanys monarch. Large parts of his early life were thus spent hunting and travelling, mounting the most exotic of animals on the palace walls as his tactical achievements, as hunting was not far removed from the realities of modern warfare. Ranging from kangeroos and alligators to elephants and a priced albino gorilla, the heads decorating the walls are lined up like a timeline, detailing Ferdinands greatest exploits.\n\nWhile the archduke enjoyed his hunting expeditions across the mystical continents of Asia, Africa and Oceania, sometimes nearly wounding himself during the process, tension brewed after the death of Rudolf II. Elisabeths political leanings terrified the upper echelons of German society, which was able to mobilise a significant portion of voters during the last election, kicking the UDP out of power in favour of the ultraconservative DV. As the conflict between Elisabeth and the new government grew, decisions needed to be made. A telegram from van den Bruck changed history, placing the giddy Ferdinand on the throne of a German Empire.\n\nNow, the many animals of Konopiště Castle have been moved into Weilburg Palace, the private residency of Emperor Ferdinand, gifted to him by the Hessian administration after his ascension to the throne. There, he monitors the situation somewhat approvingly, giving a carte blanche to the DV and its imperial ambitions, yet, due to his absolutist tendencies, remains stubborn in his pragmatically pacifist views. No irresponsible war shall be started during his reign.\n\nBut what is an "irresponsible war" really?"
  GER_Elisabeth_I_Desc:0 "Empress of Austria, Empress of the United Kingdoms of Germany, Queen of Bohemia, Apostolic Queen of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Lodomeria and of Illyria, Queen of Jerusalem and so forth. Archduchess of Austria, Duchess of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola, Margrave in Moravia, Princess of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n§YBorn:§! 2/9/1883\n\n§YElisabeth Marie Henriette Stephanie Gisela§! is the daughter of the now abdicated Kaiser Rudolf II and Baroness Mary Vetsara. Much of the Kaiserins early life is unremarkable, having received very little interest from Empress Elisabeth of Germany, who reportedly detested her status as a grandmother. The Kaiserins education and upringing were similarly standard for a member of the Austrian Royal Family, though she would rebuff pressures from her Father to marry the Hohenzollern crown prince, an incident that would strain tensions between the two families.\n\nFollowing the death of Franz Joseph and the accession of Rudolf to the throne, the Archduchess would take a more prominent role in Austrian politics. Most notably she openly endorsed the post-war socialist governments and offered her support to the womens suffrage movement in Austria. Now, imbued with the powers of the sovereign, the \"Red Kaiserin\" can push her agenda of reform."
  POLITICS_KARL_DONITZ_DESC:0 ""The North German does not go in for extremes. He has broader horizons than the men from the mountains of Bavaria and Austria."\n\n§YBorn:§!16/9/1891\n\nKarl Dönitz earned his glory, in the Great War he served in the German Navy like no other sailor could show. He is efficient, ruthless and seems to feel not a bit of pressure. At the end of the war he became of Germanys Greatest War Heroes. He continued to serve in the Navy gaining prestige and ranks through his persistance on continuous development of Naval Technology and Doctrines. With his rising tensions in the recent years in the Pacific the now Admiral Dönitz was dispatched as Statthalter to the Pacific Commonwealth. There he hopefully shall root out rising internal resistance and shield the colonies from foreign aggression.\n\nHowever if we look under the facade of Admiral Dönitz we might learn more about what a man he truly is."

  PB_GER_Economic_Depression:0 "The Long Depression"
  PB_GER_Economic_Depression_desc:0 "The interwar years have not been kind to the German Empire. The failed colonialist policies and foreign policy blunders of the Ludendorf government, combined with the immediate economic crash after the end of hostilities in 1910, contributed a general depression across the entire continent. This lead to political instability throughout the Empire, driving away foreign investment and forcing Germany to lean on their internal industries and colonies to survive. This has lead to a Germany dramatically weakened and produced an unheard of 13% unemployment rate, with poverty running rampant."

Eastern Germany and Prussia remain a hotbed of ultranationalist sentiments, with the Prussian Freikorps, or Free Corps, a constant problem with the local authorities. These hyper-reactionary militias frequently come into conflict with both the police and leftist political leaders, leading Eastern Germany to gain a reputation for being unstable and dangerous."

The Liberals in the UDP hope to provide a progressive future for Germany, prosposing economic liberalization, massive reforms to the ducation system, and new measures to improve our military and fight extremists. Finally, the arch-conservative DV promises to fight against degenerate modernism, create a world-class army and war economy, and strengthen the power of the government.

Though we certainly respect ethnic and cultural autonomy, as the German people are a diverse nation, we cannot allow for outdated administrative borders and petty princes to stand in the way of our plans for Germany.

Ultimately, the Philippines have not only shown the very worst side of Germany in our treatment of the indigenous populace, but have been wholly unprofitable, as whatever revenue we extract from the islands is spent on keeping down the numerous Jacobin revolutionaries.

Though some might criticize our measures as ironically rather socialistic, we know that only the strong hand of the state can save us from socialism and poverty. Firstly, we must institute a provisional hike in taxation across the board in order to pay off our debts and ensure we can balance the budget for a more sound economic future. Sccondly, the Economic Ministry will be given additional powers to provide economic stimulus to expanding businesses, forging a strong alliance with the capitalist class even as we institute many elements of a planned economy, albeit temporarily.

Our generals have become complacent, believing the tactics that got us through the bloodshed of the Great War will surely get us through another. They could not be more wrong. Spies in Paris and Moscow tell of terrifying new weapons and radical schools of military thought. Drastic change is in order if we are not to be swept away to the dustbin of history."

In the years since, this technology has advanced from a mere novelty to a terrifyingly powerful form of weapon. The Reichsarmee of the future should use strikes by mobile, armored forces to blow open enemy lines and destroy our enemies before they have the chance to regroup. "

We must take the same approach with our military. Our artillery must be the most accurate, able to hit targets far away with ease and percision. Our new Mechs must be produced to the finest standards, able to withstand the elements and enemy fire without breaking down or being destroyed.

Unfortunately, without proper countermeasures, this would totally negate the advantage we get from our armored forces.

Let every man know: Not One Step Back!"

  PB_GER_Keitel_Wave_Offenses_desc:0 "The concept of the wave offensive is rather simple. At first, the enemy may be able to resist our assaults using planned defenses and the such. After identifiying their weakpoints, we will crash wave after wave of offensives against the thinnest part of their lines before they inevitably drown in an ocean of their own blood."

  PB_GER_Mobile_Warfare_Doctrine_Combine_desc:0 "The Reichsarmee and the Luftwaffe currently stand as two independent commands. Though an independent Air Force brings us many advantages, namely our pilots not having to answer to men who have never been in a pilots seat, Rommel believes that victory in the next war can only be achieved only by close cooperation between our land and air forces. He has set to work developing new theories on how to best utilize our growing air fleet in conjunction with infantry and landships. Some say it cannot be done, but Rommel begs to differ."
  PB_GER_Mobile_Warfare_Doctrine_Philosophy:0 "Refining the Philosophy of Movement Warfare"
  PB_GER_Mobile_Warfare_Doctrine_Philosophy_desc:0 "Mobile Warfare, in some form or another has been a staple of war since the beginnings of civilization. From the chariots of the Ancient Egyptians to the modern landship, speed has always been a boon in crushing enemy defenses and seizing key objectives on the battlefield. With our recent innovations in military technology and doctrine, Rommel has sought to perfect the Bewegungskrieg once and for all. Blitzkrieg -- Lightning Warfare, will see us strike the enemy from the sky and ground alike with a deadly trifecta of air support, landship fleets, and armored infantry to punch a path to victory."

Perhaps if his descendants had listened, it may have been the French who triumphed in the Great War. We shall not make their mistakes. Our expansion of the army will require massive quantities of food, fuel, medical supplies, and raw materials to keep our war effort going and prevent the enemy from merely starving us into surrender. Per Rommels request, the Logistics Department will be greatly expanded and given more seniority among the branches of the General Staff."

And thus we must prepare and protect not only our physical borders, but also our arial borders by stationing Anti-Air canons a few kilometres from the border to counter French aircraft. And that we must invest great resources into protecting the German soil and people from the bombings of the ruthless French."

Which is where radars come in play, not only do we not need eyes in the field anymore, we also don't need to lose many men as the radar provides a safe distance from the battle field while still being very useful to counter our enemys airforce. Thus Goering has put together a plan in which we shall build a wall of radars to shield the great nation of Germany from those pesky French planes during a war."

It is said that the one who is quicker in evolving war will be the one with little or without casualties, and especially the recent inventions in Self Propelled Rockets, as they are called, can take out vast enemies at once.

  germany.1.t:0 "The Kaisers New Years Address"
  germany.1.d:0 "As the new year begins, celebrations throughout Germany have begun to peeter out. Early in the morning, Kaiser Rudolf II appeared before a gathered crowd in Frankfurt to deliver his new years address. His speech contained little in terms of tangible promises to the people, keeping in line with his generally apolitical stance, but of particular note was his consistent references to the need for \" more modern leadership for the Empire.\"\n\nThese cues, coupled with the Kaisers general withdrawal from public life, has lead to concerns among the nobility of weakness. Though the Kaiser has rebuffed any concerns from his advisors to the contrary, it has become something of an open secret that the Kaiser has sought retirement from his position for some time. The Kaisers retreat from publicity has lead to greater indirect power being vested in the hands of the Autonomous Kingdoms, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria supposedly mocking the Kaiser as \"feminine and weak\" for focusing more on his family life.\n\nRegardless, the government does not run on rumors, and Chancellor Stresemann believes that he can finally push his reform plan through the Bundestag this year."
  germany.1.a:0 "Perhaps 1933 will finally be our year..."

  germany.2.t:0 "Bread Riots in the Rhineland"
  germany.2.d:0 "Political violence is not unheard of in Germany, and almost a decade of economic downturn has lead to many instances of rioting. In Koblenz, however, a series of bread riots rapidly got out of control, leading to nearly twenty five deaths and dozens of injured.\n\nRelief efforts in the Rhineland have been ongoing for the last year due to crop failures, and the region continues to suffer from one of the nations higher poverty rates. According to witnesses, bread being distributed in a poorer neighborhood of Koblenz escalated into violence when bread supplies began to run out. After being denied their ration, reportedly several men assaulted the relief workers before being shot by the police. In the ensuing chaos, four police officers were tackled and beaten while relief offices were ransacked.\n\nMinister-President Goebbels has sent a furious letter to the offices of Frankfurt, demanding the deployment of the Nationalgarde to Koblenz."

  germany.3.d:0 "Stresemann met with the Kaiser earlier this morning over lunch, and returned to his office visibly shaken. When questioned, he stated that the Kaiser confided in him that he planned to abdicate the throne. According to the Chancellor, the Kaiser was open that the stress of rule and his advancing age had begun to severely affect his health.\n\nHis statements are not without merit, Stresemann stated, as the Kaiser had been hospitalized in 1930 following a bout of pneumonia. Though the incident was largely kept out of the papers, the event had \"made his majesty acutely aware of his mortality.\"\n\nThough there are no legitimate concerns regarding succession, Stresemann believes that the abdication is \"exactly the kind of chaotic mess we can't afford right now.\""

Now people were remembering one important detail surrounding all of this. The Kaiser had only one heir, his daughter Elisabeth Marie.\n\nA woman. After 250 Years a woman would again come to bear the title of Kaiser. However everyone knew she would not become the next Maria Theresa. While personal friends often give her the nickname of 'Erzsi', the public and especially her greatest doubters call her the'Red Princess'. Elisabeth has made some years ago pubibly that she believes in the values of socialism, peace and unity. Despite being forbidden to join a party, she has several contacts and friends in the labour party and she herself organized food banks for poor people during this depression.\n\nDespite protests of several politicians, Rudolf insisted that she would suceed him as Kaiserin. And so when all Germans were able to see the coronation of their new Kaiserin on television, it is not unfounded to say that they had the same thoughts in those moments.\n\n What will happen now?"

  germany.5.d:0 "Though most Germans are at the very least acquiescent to Kaiserin Elisabeths ascension to the throne, not all are willing to accept a woman at the head of the German state. The most vocal opposition to the new monarch is from Prince Georg, who insists that not only is Elisabeth wholly incapable of ruling, but that a woman has no place on the throne at all. Normally, such a statement would be considered outright sedition, but to the horror of many left-leaning politicians, a large segment of the right-wing parties in the Bundestag have stood behind his claim. Their concerns largely stem not from shared sentiments of misogyny but from Elisabeths openly left-wing rhetoric. Though by law, members of the Royal Family are forbidden from joining any political party or holding elected office, this has not stopped Her Majesty from calling for socialist reforms and trying to present herself as an \"Empress of the People\".\n\n Though this has earned her the love of the working class, the conservative coalition led by the DV in the Bundestag is vehemently opposed to such statements from the throne. Elisabeths reign may turn out very short indeed depending on how the Bundestag votes on the matter of Prince Georges claim."

Born in Kolberg, Brandenburg-Prussia, Hirschfeld spent the interwar years pioneering his research of alternative sexuality.\n\nHirschfeld’s most notable work in recent years has been his advocacy for the concept of “spectrum sexuality.” Spectrum Sexuality argues for the idea of gender and sexual preference as a fluid concept and independent of one-another, going against the traditional sexology studies on the subject. In addition to this, Hirschfeld has been a prominent advocate of homosexual rights throughout Germany, often butting heads with more conservatively minded politicians. Up until recently, the Hirschfeld Institute of Sexual Studies has been funded by private investors, however now Hirschfeld himself has approached the German government to seek official support."

Before the stranger could escape, he was apprehended by the local police and taken in for questioning. The man he targeted, 44 year old local Adolf Hitler, died from his wounds shortly after the attack. Hitler, a local painter in the Vienna Artist Commune, served a brief term of service in the Reichsheer before being forced to retire due to wounds suffered from a French gas attack\n\nThe unidentified stranger, who spoke with an abnormal German dialect, explained frantically about \"going to the wrong timeline\" and showed investigators a series of photos of what appeared to be people behind barbed wire and some kind of large mushroom-shaped explosion. When it was explained that he would be indicted for murder, the man claimed he \"shouldn't have rounded up his calculations\" before gunning down the two interviewing officers with a hidden automatic pistol and escaping the police station. Police were unable to find where the man had escaped to, but did find that he had left a leather jacket with a few personal affects.\n\nAmong the strangers possessions was a small black device with a plastic exterior and a button that would open it to reveal a key. Several buttons on the top would cause a small red light to flash as well. The items were handed off to Evidenzburo officials the following day, who plan to continue investigating the bizarre murder."

The assassin has been caught by the local police, and is believed to be a radical who opposes the current German government. After the police took a glance at his past records, he has been arrested for petty crimes and has spent time in a mental facility near Munich, where he was released a few weeks prior, from which he returned to his home town of Wurzburg, and made the decision sadly some people had to witness.\n\nThe police have also said that they believe he wasn’t acting alone, and that this action was not just because of his illness, they believe someone talked him into doing this, however there is not yet any evidence to support this claim. Witnesses say that not even the Great War compares to the way Mr. Schroeter was murdered, so brutal, so toughtless and so inhumane. It has been rumoured that a kid present during the murder was watching it happen, and hasn’t left his room since then.\n\n The local government is deciding whether to bring the man to justice or whether to hang him because of his crimes, no choice will seem to be made anytime soon. The public is firmly against justice, and wants his head off, maybe even with a public execution, however from the local government no response has yet to come to this idea.

The Second Battle was over quickly with the complete destruction of the Czech Legions.\n\nWhile some elements of the Legion might have gone underground the leadership decided to fight until the bitter end.

When the citiziens of their respective towns woke up they found small militias occupying their streets proclaiming a 'New German Empire'. The people inside the cities are outraged by the actions of the militias and we have heard of no one siding with them.\n\nDespite this the militias have heavily entreched themself with weaponry and forcefully removing them would cost a lot of lives. Some suggest to simply wait out the militias as they have not planned for any supplies like food or regular shelter. Their morale will soon fade when they realize that they are pracitcly doing nothing. Furthermore several citiziens have organized large protests inside their respective towns against the Imperalists demanding that they stop this foolish drama.\n\nMaybe the people can show how much they truly value their democracy?"

They never planned to organize any supplies so when their stomachs growled they had no idea what to do. Some simply went home and others tried robbing stores.\n\nBut soon the boiling point was breached and the public breached the checkpoints and barricades and went after them. The fools of the NVD did not know what to do and fled. Those who were catched experienced the worst day in their life and the ones who got away fled the country.\n\nThis embarrassment has practically caused the remaining NDV to collapse and to become politically unimportant."

  germany.70.d:0 "Slogans and anti-semetic slander filled the halls of the German government as the Chancellor stood his place at the podium. Rathenau waited patiently for these voices of discontent to stay silent, his gaze searched through the Reichstag before falling upon Hungenberg for a brief moment. And then, the Chancellor began his response:\n\n“Honourable and noble members of this Diet, you have heard very...colourful terms used in response to one of our most recent pieces of legislation, talk of spies and conspiracy amongst the Jewish population of our nation, especially from the right honourable Hugenberg. But I come to you requesting a chance to speak and offer my perspective on our nation’s actions. And fortunately I have been granted an opportunity to do so.\n\nMany of those who do not approve of the actions of our government claim that Jews are traitors, thieves, with more than a few of them disputing their very humanity, along with their citizenship and the status of this land as their home. You call us traitors and cowards, but ignore our sacrifices during the war. Hundreds if not thousands of Jews volunteered, giving life and limb for Germany. You claim we have taken our money, while it is Jewish businesses that contribute to our economy. And you say that Germany is not our land, that there is no greater honour than driving us out. But we have lived here for centuries, long before any of you were born. Even in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, my people were here; we have earned our place in Germany.\n\nYou claim that such beliefs and practices are noble, but where is the honour in driving away honest hard working people who sacrificed everything for a country that berates them! That does everything they can to fix our ailing economy, just as any other German would! All while you ignore the storm clouds forming over Europe, the Revanchism of France grows as it eyes to absorb our territory. If you truly cared for Germany, you would see the real threat rather than chasing make believe boogeymen who only exist in your imagination! Bring us together, instead of dividing us apart.”\n\nThe ministers and politicians cheered, waving the flags of Germany, celebrating this speech as a victory in itself. Over the tide of anti-semitism, as Rathenau looked out to the crowd, he could see the quiet fury of Hungenberg, he knew this would be an uphill battle. But this was a start."

The rampant illiteracy inside the colonies has improved very little.\nFurthermore the treatment of the African Workers is still subhuman. Standardized Working Conditions have not been implemented and in several places Africans are forced to work for entire days with no rest bordering Slavery. This practice does not even really benefit the Empire economicially it hinders the progression of its potential working class and only helps to increase the pockets of African Landlords.\nLastly the greatest issue plagueing all colonies has been a severe need of bureaucracy. Administral region are in several regions not clearly defined, neither their rules, functions, powers or whatever. Everywhere lawmakers are missing to handle corruption and oversee the progression of development. While reading through the reports, one gets the impression that we sometimes do not even know what kind of lands we actually control!\n\nHowever while the discorveries of the Conference were gut-wrenching to resolve to fix these issues have never been higher. Germany needs to compete with all Great Powers in the world and for that we need a stable realm.

Despite owning them now for several decades the development inside the colony is remarkebly slow especially in the hinterlands. We took great pride in gaining a corridor from West to East but there are no real transportation ways to get from Libravilla to Dar es Salaam on ground.\nInstead of facing this challenge, we supported the United Kingdom with Geoforming Project in Africa allowing Lake Chad to its ancient times and create new future farm land. A new capital is needed in the most promising region of Afrika.\n\nIn our Southern Colony great discoveries have been made. Large amounts of rare materials, like Nickel, Tin and Chromium have been found and a lot more could be excavated with modern equipment and infrastructure. However the administration in Südwestafrika has a rather brutal administration regarding its native population and for further increased mining we must stabilize the colony.\n\nThere are so many more problems.

At first we thought that the colony with strong Europaen Cutlural Ties would be easy to control however it seems like their are quite resistant to our presence and even a small rebellion has broken out in December of 1932. The future of the Philipines will be decided by the acions of Dönitz and the Government in Frankfurt if it choses so.\n\nThe most imprortant factor in this theater of the world is always Japan. Since their Jacobin Revolution people fear that Japan could escalate their demands of liberation in the Pacfific. Due to this Dönitz demands greater reinforcements to the Eastern Forces. He requires naval bases, fortifications, dockyards, ships, fuel and so much more to defend against the glooming Japanese Threat as he calles it.\n\nSeveral gentlemen here wonder if the claims of Dönitz are really to be taken serious and are not just hysteria. It seems like that even if Japan would do the most unthinkable that would never get past the British Islands and their navy and so it is seen as a necassity to reinforce the Far East.\n\nHowever there still might be problems in the Former French Colony in Australia. The Republic of Australie appears to be be quite bitter about their defeat and losses in Great War and some say that they still regard themself as part of the French Realm.

  germany.183.d:0 "The conference on the status of French and Russian war criminials of the Second Great War, simply known as the Lyon Trials, were held 10:00 a.m. within the French city of Lyon. The city miraculously avoided any major urban firefights or long drawn out sieges thanks to the mayors willingness to surrender the French garrison in the city without much of a fight. The location was decided upon after the both the German and British government had jointly decided that Paris was simply not suitable to host any form of official conference, let alone one that would decide the fate of the many war criminals that had come about during the war. Parisian infrastructure was virtually none existent and both parties quickly decided that the largely intact Lyon would suit the conference best, with the court hearings and procceedings being held within the once defunct parliament house.\n\nThe first matter of the Trials was the topic of the SP and their role in the war. Many disturbing atrocities, especially towards jews, had taken place under SP leadership and whilst the investigation into some of the worst of these atrocities are sill on going the verdict had been made clear by the court; death by hanging for those responsible for crimes against humanity. The next topic of discussion was that of the French and Russian military, numerous violations of the rules of war were broken on many occasions by important individuals originating from the armed forces of these nations and it can be argued that such individuals were responsible for Frances warmongering attitude. The court decided on a case by case basis and many high ranking military officials had either received the death penalty or life imprisonment. The final discussion point of the day was that of the individuals who held government jobs and the country leaders themselves. Both economists under the French and Russian government utilised slavery in different forms to full their war machines. They were also complacent in the mistreatement of prisoners of war as well as occupied populations and arguably encouraged it. These government officials mostly got away from having the death penalty besides some extreme cases. Finally was the topic of the leaders of France and Russia. This was the most long and drawn out area of the Lyon Trials and lawyers on either side passionately argued that both parties were responsible for the enviroment that lead these nations to the path of war, they also pointed out the hypocrisy in the British and German empires who had achieved their world status by conquering other nations much in the same vein as the French and Russian governments. However the court did not budge and came to the conclusion that both leaders were to be hanged and their bodies cremated in undisclosed locations. By the end of the week the trials had concluded and most of the individuals responsible for the horrors of the Second Great War were either dead or locked up indefinitely. Europe must now rebuild itself, piece by piece, and undo the mistakes of the past else it face the monster of vengeance once again."

  germany.666.d:0 "This is it. This is most likely the end of your game. I hope you had fun with the United Kingdoms of Germany and Bugs did not ruin your experience.\n\nMaybe you will not even see this event but nonetheless, I want to express my thanks to everyone who helped me on Germany.\n\nThere is Weis, propably the best GFX Artist I know in this community. He helped me early when I started working here and his icons are just beautiful. With every single day that passed the quality of his icons just became better and better. Thank you Weis.\n\nI want to thank every localisation writer who helped me write focus descriptions, events or decisions. English is not my main language and writing long complicated texts has always put my modding on a pause. But thanks to you guys, we were able to give lore and life to Germany. Thank you Silent King, Tapir, Erwin, Soble and Mimi.\n\nI want to thank everyone who helped with coding. May you be from the development team or the Mod Coop, you always helped me with the tedious Hoi4 Code. I was able to advance my modding skills thanks to you and hope that I will learn lot more in the future. Thank you Bernie, Grestin, Stallone, Fausi, Nilo, Zero, Two Wat and so many others.\n\nWe all supported and helped each other so we could be able to release this mod. I want to thank so many more like Boring for his 3D Model Expertise, the Music Guys, the people who made me laugh and so many more but we would reach the limit of the event space.\n\nLastly I want to experess my own gratitude to be able to work on this mod. I have worked on several Hoi4 mods in the past but this is the first one where I really felt like that there was a vision for the setting. That there was a genuine desire to create fun gameplay for the players. And that there is such a great development team. Thank you Grestin and Bernie for accepting my application.\nThis is the first time I worked on major country on modding, including making custom mechanics.
