WWW_Flavor.1.d:0 "In recent years the Midwestern States have had to deal with a rather nasty affair in the circumstances of a vast drought caused by several duststorms to the southwest, alongside many of the irrigation processes of the Farming Corporations of the Midwestern Provinces and some in the Southern Ones, not to mention vast pollution dumping in the Ohio River.\n\nWhile much of the affects have been mitigated due to Commonwealth's capabilities in gathering the necessary agricultural goods from the Northwestern Territories, the Southern Provinces, and even going so far as to increase agricultural production in Nicaragua despite the nativist rebellions in the regions. However, this has rather put a rather sizable dent in the Commonwealths reputation of being the Breadbasket of the Empire, alongside the Empire's food supplies. Quickly utilizing much of the Imperial Fruit Company's many preservation processes, despite concerns reguarding the sustainability of such practices.\n\nHoping to mitigate their losses or even bring a return to the agricultural stability in the region, the EIEC has sponsored an experimental solution to the drought utilizing a swarm of artifical rainfall drones. Though, some aeronautics corporations and even local farmers have protested the decision-claiming it may even make thing worse, several citizens within the Commonwealth look at the attempt with hope that the efforts will bring an end to food rationing in the nation."

WWW_Flavor.2.d:0 "To many a surprise, the mighty attempt by the UC Parliament to find a solution to the Smog-Bowl Crisis has amazingly enough Succeeded. Though the rather continuous rainfall had many worried of the potential of a potential natural disaster.\n\nThe surrounding dust of the Smog-Bowl has rather dissapated, though the agricultural and pollution practices are still taking place, so many view this as a rather temporary solution to the issue due to the many corporations not really learning their faults and its believed that vast irrigation practices will potentially cause another dustbowl or eventually cause the area to become slightly more arid. Though in the aftermath, there have been talks in the UC Parliament in allowing for some preemptive measures and perhaps even regulations to safeguard ecological environments, though not many bills have been pushed forward to emplace these regulations beyond a few considerations from the Progressive Party and National Worker's Party.\n\nThe victory has gained the UC Parliament much prestige, along with due to the support of Edison Electric there have been some who believe the superb victory will potentially allow for an opening of a comercial aeronautics sister company of the EIEC, though the corporations has stated they have no plans of doing so."

WWW_Flavor.3.d:0 "The UC Parliament's Attempt to find a quick solution to the Smog-Bowl Crisis has ended in near complete failure. The constant rainfall has caused several landslides, completely devestating several farms and villages to the West outside the protection of the UC, alongside some inside the lands of the Midwest Provinces of the very citizens they were attempting to help.\n\n Along with this a small scandal occurred when the drones used would drops polluted water on the lands, causing manmade acid rain to fall on the denizens below. Not to mention many folks from the lawless lands of the West would proceed to at the drones-likely believing them to be some sort of monster, causing a few losses to Edison Electric's Assets. \n\nThe overall failure of the effort would cost the Government only a few millions due to the assistance granted from the EIEC, however, officials from the Corporation had demanded some form of recompense though with Parliament dealing with the fallout of the Automation Crisis, no efforts have been made to allow for such payments."

WWW_Flavor.4.d:0 "Though in recent days the Smog-Bowl would mostly affect our provinces not as dearly as the areas outside our direct jurisdiction into the lawless lands of the West. Many would lose their lands, homes, and even lives itself. The great Smog-Bowl would inevitably create a vast sense of complete chaos West, outside of major settlements, those who would attempt to still live in their lands would end up facing a paril more colloquially called the Dustbowl Bandits, mostly utilizing several lawless behaviors in order to acquire things like supplies. \n\nThese bandits would mostly keep to their Western areas beyond the Louisiana River, never really venturing into the Commonwealth's land lest they face the force of the Empire. Today, however, in the Province of Tallifero a group of raiders and bandits(perhaps not realizing that they were in UC territory) attempted a large scale robbery, attempting to steal many of our citizens Food, Water, and even Money, before they could escape West in what appeared as heavily modified Ford vehicles-including armour and in some circumstances mounted firearms, a small garrison of the Province's Homeguard surrounded the town completely ensnaring the would be perpetrators.\n\n Once the evildoers realized their situation, they rather quickly surrendered to the authorities, with the exception of one who attempted to go out in a blaze of glory-however, once quickly jumping outside the surrounded petrol station, was quickly shot by a hero from the Homeguard.\n\nThe attempt received rather minimal casualties, with the exception of a few injuries and one death. The situation was rather scary for several of those involved, though it truly is amazing that such lawlessness would allow itself to be let into the Commonwealth's border."

Teagle, was obviously outraged at the occurence and had demanded compensation as well as free transport in Ford's Domains in exchange for the losses. When questioned about the attack by numerous reporters, Ford's Public Affairs agent refused to comment on the instance - while still refusing any sort of compensation towards the Standard Oil Corporation, and even commenting that the district where the attack happened was indeed Ford's and that the Standard Oil convoy should not have been there. \n\nIt should be noted that several delegates from Standard Oil have suggested that they begin to engage in an extended conflict begin between the two corporations due to such increased tensions. \n\nMany of our citizens are quite worried about what might happen if amends aren't made between the two. The Imperial Parliament has urged the two to make amends for the stability of the Empire's markets."
