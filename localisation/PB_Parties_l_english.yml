 NI_VARIANT_01:0 "§YNew Imperialists§!"
 NI_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§YNeo-Imperialism§! is less of a unified ideology and more a set of similar principles shared by different groups. While 19th Century Imperialism was born out of the mission to civilize and a need for resources, New Imperialism was born out of the cultural chaos of the Great War's aftermath.\n\nUnlike a conventional dictatorial system, Neo-Imperialism advocates for the grand expansion of the state to dominate their neighbors both culturally, economically and politically. The concept of cultural dominance is particularly prevalent, as Neo-Imperialists believe in the inherent superiority of their home culture, and often see other cultures as inferior. This often extends to the topic of race, with Neo-Imperialists advocating for obliteration of so-called savage cultures and identities. Though there are naturally variances, Neo-Imperialists are almost invariably violent expansionists with aims on their neighbors and the world at large."

 NI_VARIANT_02:0 "§YUltranationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§YUltranationalism§! is a form of extreme nationalism focusing on the importance of one state or racial group above all others. Unlike Neo-Imperialism, Ultranationalism is not couched in Victorian concepts of racial superiority. Instead, it focuses on a xenophobic distrust of other races, seeking to eliminate them alltogether rather than forcefully assimilate them. Many ultranationalists hold a mythologized view of their national history, drawing on ancient or even mythical origin stories to build an extremist mythology around their people."

 NI_VARIANT_03:0 "§YNational Syndicalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§YNational Syndicalism§! is a form of left-wing extreme nationalism intended to fuse the nationalist struggle and class struggle. Under National Syndicalism, Trade Unions are often a key aspect of the integral national struggle. It disregards concepts like democratization or reformism in favour of reactionary political policies combined with mildly progressive social policies. In many cases, the means of production are concentrated in the hands of the state, rather than the proletariat."

 NI_VARIANT_04:0 "§YClerical Ultranationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§YClerical Ultranationalism§! is, as the name implies, a synthesis of religious dogma and ultranationalist reactionary doctrine. The church, or alternate religious equivalent, holds major value as an organ of the nationalist state. Dogma is a principle motivating factor in government decisions, but not the sole factor as typical nationalist ideology still holds considerable sway."

 NI_VARIANT_05:0 "§YRevolutionary Nationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§YRevolutionary Nationalism§! is a combination of Revolutionary Republicanist ideas and ultranationalist doctrine. Birthed during the tumultous interwar years of the French Republic, Revolutionary Nationalism was first described by French thinker Georges Sorel. He argued for taking the revolutionary republicanist aspect of Jacobinism and combining it with a strong, militaristic reactionary state. In recent years, the ideology has been pushed by French Armandists, their titular idealogue being former Jacobin Inessa Armand. "

 DS_VARIANT_01:0 "§YDespotists§!"
 DS_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§YDespotism§! is a blanket ideology often ascribed to dictatorships, absolute monarchies and other right-wing authoritarian states. Though they can very wildly in domestic and foreign policy, despotic regimes will always do everything in their power to crush domestic threats to their power.\n\nThese regimes are often extremely militaristic, focusing on a mixture of reactionary values and propaganda to encourage an almost fanatically loyal population, or, at the very least, a population unwilling to openly challenge their dictates."
 
 DS_VARIANT_02:0 "§YAbsolutism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§YAbsolutism§! is an overarching ideology to describe nations where a hereditary monarch holds complete power over the entire government. While there may be individuals in an advisory role, an absolutist government will always centralize all power in the hands of the sovereign."

 DS_VARIANT_03:0 "§YPan-African Nationalism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§YPan-African Nationalism§! is a subset of Pan-Africanist thought that focuses on the nationalist aspect of Pan-African theory. Pan-African Nationalists seek to forge a unified African state based on common identity between African peoples, superseding tribal rivalries. This ideology is more common amongst black nationalist circles such as Garveyites in Hispaniola."

 DS_VARIANT_04:0 "§YPan-Arab Nationalism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§YPan-Arab Nationalism§! is a subset of Pan-Arabist thought emphasizing the nationalistic elements of the Arab unification movement. Pan-Arab Nationalists are not typically democratic, pushing for a united nationalist vanguard party with limited social reforms. They chiefly focus on industrialization and secularization of Arab society."

 DS_VARIANT_05:0 "§YTechnocratic Despotism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§YTechnocratic Despotism§! is a system of government by which the country is run in a non-democratic manner by technical or scientific specialists. Technocrats believe that democratic ideals are intrinsically against effective management of the government, and believe almost religiously in a form of scientific meritocracy."

 DS_VARIANT_06:0 "§YAuthoritarian Democracy§!"
 DS_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§YAuthoritarian Democracy§! is a system of government where democracy is conducted by the ruling elite of an authoritarian state in an effort to represent the varying interests of a society. In most cases, this manifests as a form of managed democracy wherin candidates are managed and approved by the ruling government to prevent the manifestation of any anti-government leadership."

 RC_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§YReactionaries§! are a distinct form of hyper-conservatives focused on pseudo-authoritarian far right doctrines. Though not always overtly authoritarian, reactionary political parties will attempt to acquire and maintain power through authoritarian means. The ideology group is not particularly unified, however, and there are significant variances between different reactionary factions.\n\nReactionary groups can vary from simply militaristic conservatives to religious fundamentalists and monarchist cliques, but they share the unifying ideal of rolling back reforms in favor of tradition and dogma. They desire a return to the old days of their nation, and are extremely hostile towards anything that might prevent their restoration of these traditions."

 RC_VARIANT_02:0 "§YReligious Fundamentalism§!"
 RC_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§YReligious Fundamentalism§! is an ideology rooted in extreme devotion to clerical doctrine. Vehemently reactionary in regards to social change, religious fundamentalists court their supporters through a fanatical obsession with their particular sect. Fundamentalist states are often insular, but if goaded, will unleash their zealous population against enemies with a frenzied zeal that many ideologies simply cannot match."

Advocating for social and economic reforms, Liberal factions are found in nearly every democracy on Earth. Liberal factions are, as their name implies, more socially liberal than other ideological groups. Many favour the introduction of suffrage for different racial groups and women.\n\nLiberals are commonplace throughout Europe, and have played pivotal roles in pushing for social liberalization in the grand empires of the continent. While not as revolutionary as it once might have been, Liberalism is still a strong force around the world in the fight for equality."

Either representing business friendly factions or factions outright run by businesses, Anarcho-Liberals are an occasionally authoritarian group with a pure focus on acquisition of capital. From the Zaibatsus of the former Japanese Empire to the British East India Company, Anarcho-Liberal factions are commonplace in nations with a focus on so-called Empire Capitalism.\n\nThough deeply disliked by most leftists, Anarcho-Liberals find their support in the boardrooms and businesses of many empires, and will often do anything in their power to continue acquisition of capital."

Though the term was used by Bismarck's enemies to mock his policies, many began to use it as a general term for policies similar to those he implemented. State Socialists are sometimes revolutionary socialists, but are not quite as extreme as Jacobins. Many advocate for democratic socialist ideas, such as the creation of welfare states and encouragement of worker's rights. Others are more extreme, such as Bukuninists that push for more Anarcho-Collectivist ideas.\n\nRegardless of specifics, with the continuing march of industrialization, State Socialists will always find their support in the factories and unions of many nations."

Developed by Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin, Collectivism rejected the idea of a revolutionary vanguard proposed my most Jacobin theorists. Instead, Bakunin proposed the idea of an nearly stateless society, operating via direct democracy. In the wake of the bloody postwar Jacobin revolutions, many disenchanted socialists embraced Bakuninist Collectivism and its' ideals of revolutionary democracy and worker's self management."

 JC_VARIANT_01:0 "Jacobinism"
 JC_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "Jacobinism is a school of thought that originated in the French Reformation. Originally espoused by Robespierre, modern Jacobins argue for the abolition of all hierachy, not just monarchy. Their principle concern is the creation of a direct democacy, often alongside the creation of a revolutionary vanguard to protect said democracy. In reality, however, this often leads to a far-left authoritarian government. Though progressive socially, Jacobin states are often despotic and militaristic, seeking to spread their revolution abroad.\n\nJacobins foster their support in the poor and defenseless, seeking to galvanize them to overturn the many crowns that pepper the Earth, bringing revolution worldwide."
 JC_VARIANT_03:0 "§YRevolutionary Imperialism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§YRevolutionary Imperialism§! is a radical, militant offshoot of Jacobinism arguing for the continued spread of the people's revolution. Revoultionary Imperialists seek to expand into surrounding nations and beyond, creating sister republics dedicated to their liberators' revolutionary ideals. Even among other Jacobins, Revolutionary Imperialists are seen as dangerous radicals, not just for their militancy but their tendency to gain traction within revolutionary militaries."

 JC_VARIANT_04:0 "§YNational Jacobinism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§YNational Jacobinism§! is the term given to the rightist branch of Jacobin thought. Originating out of Germany, National Jacobinism grew as a rejection of French Classical Jacobinism, which was a distinctly liberal ideology. National Jacobins, instead, appeal to the militaristic and more socially conservative members of society. While still arguing for revolutionary republicanism, National Jacobins are against social reformism and believe in the importance of maintaining societal norms. In this way, National Jacobins are socially reactionary but economically collectivist. In many ways, the militant conservative nature of National Jacobins is more comparable to Neo Imperialist thought than Classical or even Reformist Jacobinist thought."

 JC_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§YClassical Jacobinism§! is an offshoot of traditional Jacobin thought that rejects the vanguardism and political tutelage of more conventional Jacobinism. Classical Jacobinism advocates for the idea of \"Revolutionary Democracy\", under which the majority of power is decentralized among the population and executive power is kept controlled via checks and balances. Though denounced by conventional Jacobins for the rejection of the vanguard, Classical Jacobins remain a prominent offshoot of Revolutionary Republican thought."

 JC_VARIANT_06:0 "§YKingoro Hashimoto Thought§!"
 JC_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§YKingoro Hashimoto Thought§! is a branch of Revolutionary Republican thought unique to the Japanese Republic. Coined by dictatorial leader Kingoro Hashimoto, Hashimoto Thought combines elements of Japanese martial values with left wing populism and revolutionary republican ideas.\n\nOriginally conceived as a means to justify his seizure of power, Hashimoto has crafted his ideology into something uniquely Japanese. Simultaneously nationalist and internationalist, decrying monarchy yet defending dictatorship, Kingoro-Hashimoto Thought is very much a product of its' environment."
